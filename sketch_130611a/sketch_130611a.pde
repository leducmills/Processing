   PURPOSE:
   This is essentially a blink sketch intended to demonstrate the basics of programming an
   Android with the Processing development environment to interact with hardware via a IOIO.
   This example blinks an LED on the IOIO board and blinks a rectangle on the Android screen.
   This example shows how the main Processing file (in this case, SIKIO_C0_quickstart.pde)
   and the IOIOThread.pde file work and interact. The main .pde file controls the Android
   user interface and the IOIOThread.pde controls the IOIO board, and the two interact
   through the use of global variables, in this case the 'lightON' variable.
   
   HARDWARE:
   This is an example that doesn't require anything other than your Android and a IOIO,
   connected by a USB cable, and a way to power your IOIO through the JST connector.
   
   OPERATION:
   Connect your android to the computer with a USB cable, and click the 'Run on Device' 
   button in the Processing IDE. Once Processing displays 'Sketch launched on the device'
   dialogue, connect your Android phone to your powered IOIO device with a USB cable.
   Every half second, the IOIO Thread sends a command to the IOIO to turn the onboard
   LED on or off. It also sets the global variable 'lightON' at that time before going
   to back to sleep. The draw loop in the main processing code (code below), 
   The sketch starts by running IOIOThread.pde. In the thread, a flag is set through the 
   global variable 'lightON', when the LED turns on and off. This global variable is read in 
   the code below and a black or white box is drawn depending on the state of the LED.
