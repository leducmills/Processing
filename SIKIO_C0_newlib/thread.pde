  PURPOSE:
  This is our thread class, it's a subclass of the standard thread class that comes with Processing.
  We're not really doing anything dramatic, just using a thread (i.e. a separate process than the main .pde file)
  to control the IOIO board. You can define global variables in the main sketch and use them here.
  
  More info on how the Processing Thread class works, see here:
  http://wiki.processing.org/w/Threading

//This is a class for the IOIO thread. It is similar to the MainActivity class in Android programming, except 
//our "MainActivity" extends to a thread that runs separate than the main .pde file. In other words, the IOIOThread 
//class inherits all of the attributes of the Java thread class. All this is doing is allowing us to use the 
//'thread' class without having to write too much extra configuration code for the thread. 
class IOIOThread extends Thread {

  //Variables for our Thread constuctor. These define the threads properties. 
  boolean running;  //is our thread running?
  String id; //in case we want to name our thread
  int wait; //how often our thread should run
  
  /*
      Your global variables or declarations for the IOIO go here. For examples on how to use the IOIO 
      libaries, see the IOIO wiki: https://github.com/ytai/ioio/wiki
