1. SDK License.

1.1   License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
      Oblong Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation with an address at

      software library, binary executables, packaged APIs and code samples,
      but otherwise not including source code), in the form and format
      provided by Oblong (the “SDK”) for the sole purpose of developing
      products, services and any other software or hardware application that
      are interoperable with Oblong g-speak and that are not (a) used or sold
      for commercial purposes, (b) produced on behalf of commercial entities or
      (c) distributed outside of Licensee’s organization (collectively,
      “Non-Commercial Applications”); and (ii) sublicense, copy, transmit and
      distribute such Non-Commercial Applications to Licensee’s affiliates in
      connection with non-commercial projects that are associated with, funded
      by or supervised by Licensee, provided that any such sublicense, copy,
      transmission or distribution shall be made subject to a sublicense
      agreement that shall include, at a minimum, the following terms and
      conditions: (1) only a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
      non-assignable right to use a copy of such Non-Commercial Applications
      is granted to such sublicensee; (2) no ownership interest in the
      Non-Commercial Applications is transferred to sublicensee; (3)
      sublicensee will not copy Non-Commercial Applications except as
      necessary to use such Non-Commercial Applications and for backup and
      archive purposes in connection with such use; (4) if a sublicensee’s
      right to use is terminated for any reason, such sublicensee will either
      destroy or return all copies of Non-Commercial Applications in its
      possession; (5) such sublicensee will not distribute, rent, lease, sell,
      offer to sell, or transfer Non-Commercial Applications to any other party
      except as authorized by Licensee; (6) such sublicensee will not export
      or re-export Non-Commercial Applications without the appropriate United
      States and/or foreign government licenses; (7) such sublicensee will not
      modify, adapt, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, create
      derivative works, or derive the source code of the Non-Commercial
      Applications; (8) Oblong and its licensors do not warrant Non-Commercial
      Applications and do not assume any liability regarding Non-Commercial
      Applications; (9) Oblong and its licensors will not be liable for any
      incidental, indirect, consequential, direct, compensatory or special
      damages; and (10) if any support is provided to the sublicensee, Oblong
      and its licensors do not undertake to furnish any support or information
      regarding Non-Commercial Applications. 

1.2   Limitations. Licensee may not, directly or indirectly, (i) use the SDK
      for any commercial purpose; (ii) make, rent, lease, sell, offer to sell,
      modify, adapt, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, create
      derivative works, or derive the source code of the SDK or any part of the
      SDK; (iii) distribute, transmit or provide the SDK or any Non-Commercial
      Application to any third party, except as expressly permitted by this
      Agreement, without the prior written consent of Oblong; or (iv) use the
      SDK for performing comparisons or other “benchmarking” activities, either
      alone or in connection with any software (and Licensee will not publish
      any such performance information or comparisons). 

1.3   Modifications. Licensee agrees that the form, function and nature of the
      SDK that Oblong provides may change without prior notice and that future
      versions of the SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on
      previous versions of the SDK. Licensee agrees that Oblong may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within
      the SDK) to Licensee or to users generally at Oblong’s sole discretion,
      without prior notice.

1.4   Support and Upgrades. If Oblong provides Licensee with any upgrades,
      patches, enhancements, or fixes for the SDK, then the items that are
      provided will become part of the SDK and subject to this Agreement.
      Oblong shall have no obligation, however, under this Agreement to provide
      any upgrades, patches, enhancements, fixes or any other support to
      Licensee for the SDK.  

1.5   Nonassertion by Licensee.  Licensee agrees not to assert any patent
      rights related to the SDK or any Non-Commercial Applications against
      Oblong, Oblong’s distributors, Oblong’s customers, or other licensees of
      the SDK for making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing any
      products or technology developed using the SDK.


2. Use of the SDK.

2.1   Ownership of Applications.  Oblong agrees that it obtains no right,
      title or interest from Licensee (or its users) under this Agreement in or
      to any software applications developed using the SDK in compliance with
      the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any intellectual
      property rights that subsist in those applications.  

2.2   Use of Applications.  Licensee agrees to use the SDK and write
      applications only for purposes that are expressly permitted by (i) this
      Agreement and (ii) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in relevant jurisdictions (including any laws
      regarding the export of data or software to and from the United States
      or other relevant countries).


3. Proprietary Rights and Confidentiality.

3.1   Trademarks. Nothing in this Agreement gives Licensee a right to use any
      of Oblong’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names,
      or other distinctive brand features.

3.2   Notices. Licensee agrees that Licensee will not remove, obscure, or alter
      any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark
      notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the SDK.

3.3   Ownership. The SDK is licensed, not sold. The SDK is protected by the
      copyright laws of the United States and international copyright treaties.
      Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted hereunder,
      no other license is granted (by implication, estoppel or otherwise),
      no other use is permitted and Oblong (and third party licensors) shall
      own and retain all rights, title and interests (including intellectual
      property rights) in and to the SDK. Licensee agrees not to take any
      action inconsistent with such ownership. Licensee acknowledges and agrees
      that Oblong is and shall be free (and shall be free to permit others) to
      use and exploit, in any manner and for any purpose, during and after the
      term of this Agreement, any and all modifications, corrections,
      improvements and extensions to the SDK that Licensee or any of its users
      may suggest to Oblong.

3.4   Confidentiality.  Licensee shall take all reasonable measures to maintain
      the confidentiality of the SDK and other Oblong technical information
      obtained by it (“Confidential Information”), and will not disclose the
      Confidential Information to any third party.  Licensee shall at all times,
      both during the term of this Agreement and thereafter until the
      Confidential Information falls into one of the exceptions below, keep in
      trust and confidence all such Confidential Information, and shall not use
      such Confidential Information other than as expressly authorized by
      Oblong under this Agreement, nor shall Licensee disclose any such
      Confidential Information to third parties without Oblong’s written
      consent. Licensee shall similarly bind its employees, consultants and
      independent contractors to the confidentiality obligations in this
      Agreement, and shall be responsible for any breaches thereof.
      Licensee further agrees to return to Oblong all Confidential Information
      (including copies thereof) in Licensee’s possession, custody or control
      upon termination of this Agreement at any time and for any reason.
      The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information which
      (i) has entered the public domain except where such entry is in result of
      Licensee’s breach of this Agreement; (ii) prior to disclosure hereunder
      was already rightfully in Licensee’s possession; (iii) subsequent to
      disclosure hereunder is obtained by Licensee on a non-confidential basis
      from a third party who has the right to disclose such information to the
      Licensee; or (iv) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a court order,
      so long as Oblong is given adequate notice and the ability to challenge
      such required disclosure.


4. Term and Termination.

      any provision of this Agreement.

4.3   Effects of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement for any
      reason, all rights, obligations and licenses of the parties hereunder
      shall cease, except that (i) Licensee shall stop using the SDK, return
      or destroy all copies of the SDK (and all records, materials and
      information developed therefrom) and permanently erase the SDK from all
      storage media, (ii) provided that this Agreement is not terminated due to
      breach by Licensee, Licensee may continue to use and sublicense any
      Non-Commercial Application developed prior to termination in accordance

      that accrued prior to the effective date of termination and any remedy

      each party.  No waiver by any party of any breach or default of by the

      state or federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, USA and both
      parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any
