
	   BARRY, Wales , Above the stretch of Victorian row houses that
meander from the docks on the Bristol Channel up to subdivisions
scattered about the peaceable coastal hills lurks the menace to
Britain's Conservatives.
	   The Tories have presided over a five-year recovery, and they
have been particularly generous to the Welsh, lavishing government
spending here at an annual rate that is nearly $1,000 a head more
than in England.
	   South Wales leads all other regions of Britain in attracting
foreign investment, including the largest Europe has ever seen, a
$2.75 billion manufacturing base under construction nearby for the
South Korean electronics giant LG.
	   Main street business is booming, auto parts and semiconductor
factories are expanding, houses are gaining value, a new
76,000-seat all-weather sports stadium is being built and the
European prime ministers have picked Cardiff as the location of
their summit conference next year.
	   All these signs of confidence and economic well-being have not
protected the Conservatives, now in power for nearly 18 years, from
the danger represented by people like Mark Stephenson, 30, a
consulting mineral surveyor who lives in a house at the end of a
cul-de-sac with his wife, Helen, and his 15-month-old son, Ross.
	   A self-described ``strong Conservative'' who has taken part in
the Tory-led prosperity, he is deserting the party he has always
voted for to support the opposition Labor Party in the general
election to be held this spring.
	   ``They don't seem to have any new ideas, any energy, and Labor
does,'' he said, seated in a living room cluttered with toys. ``No
one has fears about putting the country in control of Labor anymore
because they've put all the old fears to rest.''JE(!$Passionate about Margaret Thatcher's free-market reforms a
decade ago, Stephenson now believes they have produced too much
social dislocation.
	   ``I've lived in the Cardiff area all my life, and I never saw
beggars in the street,'' he said. ``Now when I go to work, I pass
15 a day, and in the valleys the deprivation is incredible.''
	   Several miles away, Keith Martin Doust, 43, was busy moving into
the new home that some inheritance money and the proceeds of a
thriving housecleaning company he owns had enabled him to buy.
	   ``After all these years, the Conservatives have no credibility
left,'' he said of the party he had always voted for until
converting to Labor this year. ``I run a business, and a lot of my
friends and clients are upper-middle-class-type people,
small-business men and managers. You could say that the
Conservatives aren't people we would want to employ anymore.''
	   It is in places like Barry, suburban communities of the young
aspiring classes that have traditionally voted Conservative, where
the 1992 American campaign truism ``It's the economy, stupid'' has
landed in Britain with a contrarian thud.
	   Prime Minister John Major repeatedly predicts that in time the
electorate will grow to appreciate the economic success of the
Tories and that the persistent double-digit lead that Labor has
been enjoying in polls will start to decline. But so far he has
been proved wrong as economic indicators continue to reflect robust
growth and Labor's lead only widens.
	   Tony Blair, the 43-year-old Labor candidate for prime minister,
has successfully transformed his party into a centrist movement
that has abandoned its socialist past, reduced its dependency on
trade union financing and broadened its membership to marginalize
the influence of left-wing factions that have cost it past
elections.
	   Eager to shed its reputation for radicalism, Labor has limited
its proposals for change to constitutional reform of the House of
Lords and proposals for considering establishing legislatures in
Wales and Scotland.
	   The party has promised it will stick to projected Conservative
spending limits for the next two years and not raise personal
income taxes for the next five. All this is being done in the name
of presenting itself as ``New Labor,'' a party that voters can
trust with governing the country.
	   Cardiff's business district rises comfortably next to the city's
imposing civic center of white Portland stone buildings, tree-lined
avenues, ceremonial gardens and pools and a domed city hall
surmounted by a Welsh dragon and a lofty clock tower.
	   In the office of King Sturge & Co., the international property
consulting concern, Robert H. Croydon, 43, the regional managing
partner, said, ``You might ask how can we identify with a party
called Labor since we are the ones who pay wages.''
	   He handed a visitor a company report calmly assessing a Labor
government's effect on its business as ``mildly beneficial.'' He
said Blair had succeeded in eliminating the ``bogeys of spending
and taxation'' from the minds of business-minded voters.
	   Past Labor leaders, he said, ``had no hope of getting across the
threshold of Stratford Place,'' referring to the address of the
company's London headquarters. ``If Tony Blair turned up, he'd be
invited in for tea and a chat.''
	   In Barry, the campaign committee for the Vale of Glamorgan
constituency has just opened up offices in a former photographer's
studio in a row house overlooking the docks that were once the
busiest coal-exporting spot in the Britain. With the closing of the
mines in the last two decades, Barry has now become a bedroom
community for Cardiff and its working suburbs and a holiday spot
for vacationers headed for the camps and amusements of the stubby
peninsula called Barry Island.
	   The Labor candidate for Parliament, John Smith, 45, runs a
business that attracts private sector funds into South Wales by
trying to replace people's old association of this area with
smokestack industries, coal mines and the militant unions , the
very sectors that gave birth to the Labor Party , with what he
called ``a positive business image.'' The party, he said, is
dedicated to overcoming its reputation for having an ``antipathy to
the creation of wealth.
	   ``It would have been unheard-of my doing this kind of thing 10
years ago,'' he said. ``It would have been the end of my political
career.''
	   Smith lost the 1992 election to a Conservative, Walter Sweeney,
a 47-year-old lawyer, by 19 votes out of the more than 50,000 cast.
Already, he said, the campaign has identified more than 1,000 sure
``switchers'' to Labor.
	   At a gathering of Welsh Conservatives last week, William Hague,
the member of Major's Cabinet responsible for Wales, told the
dwindling faithful that ``the prospects for Wales are the best they
have been in a generation.''
	   It was not lost on commentators that the town the conference was
held in, Holywell, is a shrine where Welsh pilgrims have
traditionally gone seeking miracles.
