
	   WASHINGTON , As the Senate rushed to adjournment earlier this
month, one odd and seemingly inconsequential item stood in the way:
the insertion of a few words in a 1923 law regulating railway
express companies.
	   It was not the kind of thing that would ordinarily seize the
attention of senators eager to go home barely a month before
Election Day. But they stayed in session until the language was
enacted, because the beneficiary of the arcane language was Federal
Express Corp., which has become one of the most formidable and
successful corporate lobbies in the capital.
	   FedEx wanted the language change because it might exempt its
operations from the National Labor Relations Act and, as a result,
help it resist efforts by unions to organize its workers.
	   Despite passionate speeches by opponents on behalf of organized
labor, the company was able to engineer a remarkable legislative
victory, prevailing upon the Senate to remain in session two extra
days solely to defeat a filibuster by its opponents.
	   ``I was stunned by the breadth and depth of their clout up
here,'' said Sen. D. Feingold, a first-term Democrat from Wisconsin
who had opposed the change. In the end, Feingold was one of 31
senators who voted against FedEx.
	   Senators say the ingredients in Federal Express' success are
straightforward, distinguished from other corporate lobbying by
degree and skillful application: a generous political action
committee, the presence of popular former congressional leaders
from both parties on its board, lavish spending on lobbying, and a
fleet of corporate jets that ferry dozens of officeholders to
political events around the country.
	   Feingold said that as he tried to rally support against the
FedEx legislation, he was frequently and fervently rebuffed by
colleagues who said they had acquired obligations to the company.
	   ``The sense I got was that this company had made a real strong
effort to be friendly and helpful to Congress,'' Feingold said.
	   He would not identify the lawmakers but said that as he
approached them about the legislation, he discovered that many just
wanted to talk about how FedEx had helped them. ``In these informal
conversations, people mentioned that they had flown in a FedEx
plane or gotten other favors,'' he said.
	   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., who proposed the amendment to help
FedEx, said he did so because he was grateful to the company for
its willingness to use its planes to fly hay to his state during
droughts.
	   But others say lawmakers benefit more directly. Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., who is retiring this fall, said that in a caucus of the
Senate's Democrats just before the recess, one senior senator
refused to oppose the company, bluntly telling his colleagues, ``I
know who butters my bread.''
	   Simon would not identify the lawmaker except to say he was a
longtime member of the Senate.
	   ``I know that I have ridden in their planes several times,''
said Simon, who opposed Federal Express on this bill. ``But what
happened here was just a blatant example of the power of their
political efforts. If the John Smith company came along and asked
for the same thing, it wouldn't have a prayer.''
	   FedEx, Tennessee's biggest private employer, makes no apologies
either for the merits of the legislation it sought or for its
efforts to establish relationships with members of Congress.
	   ``We play the game as fairly and aggressively as we can,'' said
Doyle Cloud, the vice president of regulatory and government
affairs for Federal Express. ``We have issues constantly in
Washington that affect our ability to deliver the services our
customers demand as efficiently as possible.''
	   For example, Cloud said, FedEx regularly seeks to make
clearances through customs easier to increase efficiency. ``To do
things like that, it's absolutely necessary that we are involved
politically as well as regulatorily,'' he said.
	   In addition to its cargo fleet, FedEx maintains four corporate
jets that, when not used for company trips, are made available to
members of Congress. Cloud said that they are used mostly to ferry
groups of lawmakers to a fundraising event and only rarely for an
individual lawmaker.
	   Congressional regulations require that lawmakers using corporate
aircraft reimburse the company for the equivalent of first-class
airfare, and Cloud said that is always done. Records maintained
publicly by Congress do not show how often members use corporate
flights. FedEx declined to make the company's records available,
but Cloud said that during peak political seasons, FedEx might fly
a group of lawmakers about once a week.
	   Two popular former lawmakers, meanwhile, serve on FedEx's board:
George Mitchell of Maine, the former Democratic leader of the
Senate, and Howard Baker, the former Republican leader of the
Senate.
	   The company's political action committee is one of the top five
corporate PACs in the nation. In the 1993-94 election cycle it gave
more than $800,000 to 224 candidates for the House and Senate.
According to the Federal Election Commission, it gave $600,500 to
candidates in this cycle through August. The company has also
donated more than $260,000 this year to the Democratic and
Republican Parties.
