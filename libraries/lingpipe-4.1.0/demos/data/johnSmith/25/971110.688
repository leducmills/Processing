	   New York, Nov. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil fell as United
Nations talks began on settling a dispute over Iraq's expulsion of
American weapons inspectors, easing concern about a possible war in
the oil-rich Middle East.
	   A U-2 spy plane on loan from the U.S. flew over Iraq without
incident after Baghdad threatened to shoot it down. The threat,
which was repeated today, came after Iraq refused to allow U.N.
inspections of suspected weapons-making sites.
	   Iraq still wants to expel Americans on the inspection team, and
the U.S. warned its military will respond if Iraq shoots at the spy
plane. The Middle East accounts for a third of the world's oil, and
any conflict could threaten supplies.
	   ``The only thing that's been supporting this market is the
possibility that something will happen in Iraq,'' said Tom Bentz,
director of energy trading at High Yield Analytics Inc. ``If you
take Iraq out of the equation, we'd have oil $1 lower a barrel.''
	   In other markets, corn and soybeans fell after a government
report forecast ample supplies. Cotton also fell and coffee rose.
The Commodity Research Bureau index shed 0.25, or 0.1 percent, to
241.10 while the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index rose
0.81, or 0.4 percent, to 204.34.
	   The CRB index is little changed from a year ago, after rising as
much as 5.5 percent and falling as much as 3.5 percent in the past
12 months. Economists say steady prices indicate raw materials
won't fuel inflation.
	   ``Commodity prices being down is certainly good news,'' said
George Kaufman, John Smith professor of finance and banking at
Loyola University-Chicago. ``It would be one indication that
inflation isn't on the horizon.''
	   December crude oil fell 37 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $20.40 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
	   Prices fell as concern eased about a possible conflict in the
Middle East. Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said in New
York that Iraq is ``ready to fulfill'' its obligations to the U.N.
weapons inspections, though Baghdad hasn't changed its decision to
expel American inspectors.
	   The expulsions were delayed while Iraq negotiates with the U.N.
Security Council, which met today. Aziz renewed his call for the
U.N. to lift economic sanctions imposed since Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
	   Corn and soybean futures plunged after the government forecast
ample supplies before the next harvest.
	   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, before trading, boosted its
forecast for corn stockpiles as of Aug. 31, the end of the
marketing year, by 19 percent to 928 million bushels, in part
because of increased competition from China. The figure was more
than the 837 million bushels expected by traders.
	   While the USDA lowered its estimate of end-of-year soybean
supplies by 5.6 percent because of strong domestic and export
demand, prices fell because the department raised its forecast for
the current harvest by almost 1 percent from last month to a record
2.74 million bushels.
	   ``Nobody is saying they're going to be left behind if they don't
jump on the train today,'' said John Petty, director of futures
operations at Grain Service Corp., an Atlanta-based consultant to
grain elevators. ``We have adequate supplies of corn and wheat,
period. And we're fine with bean supplies.''
	   December corn fell 8.25 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.7575 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest closing price for
the contract since Oct. 6. January soybeans fell 18 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $7.215 a bushel.
	   The department also raised its estimate of the current corn
harvest by 0.5 percent to 9.359 billion bushels, still the
third-largest crop ever.
	   The USDA also unexpectedly raised its estimate of this year's
cotton harvest to 18.85 million bales, the fourth-largest crop on
record, driving prices lower. The government's crop estimate was
higher than last month's 18.41-million-bales forecast and exceeded
analysts' expectations for a decline to 18.33 million bales.
	   December cotton fell 2.14 cents, or 3 percent, to 69.93 cents a
pound on the New York Cotton Exchange.
	   Coffee rose to a three-week high as torrential rain and gusting
winds from Hurricane Rick lashed Mexico's main coffee growing
regions, threatening the crop.
	   Crops being harvested in the Chiapas and Oaxaca states, Mexico's
largest growing regions, are likely to suffer more damage than
during Hurricane Pauline last month because cherries on the trees
are now mature and more likely to be blown to the ground. Mexico is
the largest source of U.S. coffee imports.
	   The storm, which reached Mexico's coast yesterday, is close to
Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas. While winds have slowed,
heavy rain is expected to last through the next 24 hours,
forecasters at Weather Services Corp. in Lexington, Massachusetts
said.
	   ``Hurricane Rick in Mexico is at a bad place at a bad time
because it's pouring with rain while they are in the middle of the
harvest,'' said Dario Sarmiento, a coffee trader at Gryphus
Investments in Miami. ``When the previous hurricane hit during
October, not all the beans were ripe, now growers could loose
mature beans.''
	   Coffee for December delivery rose 7.05 cents, or 4.7 percent, to
$1.5685 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New York,
its highest price since Oct. 16.
