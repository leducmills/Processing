	   MIAMI , My morning workout partner asked the other day what I
thought of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to review the
constitutionality of Arizona's ``Official English'' law.
	   An advocate of English-only, he sensed that I would be
protective of the statute. I wasn't.
	   ``I thought all that Spanish going on around you was driving you
to distraction,'' he said.
	   It is, I confessed, but added that no state or federal law
declaring English the official language of the United States, or of
California or Arizona or Florida, can change that.
	   In the Miami area, where now more than half the population is of
Hispanic origin or heritage, Spanish is spoken everywhere ,
seemingly, at times, more than English.
	   But all the vengeful official English laws can do is mandate
that English must be spoken in governmental meetings, or in court;
that it be the only language on voter ballots, and the only
language spoken in the public schools, where learning another
language often is part of the required curriculum.
	   Where English-only speakers find themselves frustrated, however,
is not so much in those venues but in ordinary day-to-day coping.
The huge shopping mall near my home is a place I rarely visit any
more. It is difficult to hear anyone speaking English there.
	   At times, I begin to feel like a stranger in my own country.
	   But the application of English-only laws would not apply to
shopping malls, any more than it would to restaurants, baseball
stadiums or back-yard conversations.
	   If every state in the union had an English-only law today, it
would not bring English back to my neighborhood shopping mall.
	   It would impact, however, on some critical areas that could
bring great harm to Hispanics. It would be only out of a sense of
meanness that we would deny Hispanics translated information
regarding government issues, actions or trials.
	   What the English-only laws do is deny a Hispanic, or Asiatic, or
a member of any other ethnic group the opportunity for a fair trial
in court if that defendant , deficient in English , is unable to
comprehend what is taking place without benefit of a translator.
	   One of the irritants at voting time in the Miami area is that
the ballots are in two languages: English and Spanish. The natural
reaction to that is that you have to be a citizen to vote, and in
order to be a citizen, you have to know English.
	   You do, but only the part that you can memorize.
	   Nevertheless, it does seem silly to see double on a ballot when
the name John Smith or Maria Fernandez appears in both the English
and Spanish versions. You don't have to be a linguist to recognize
a name.
	   Where bilingual ballots do fill a need is in the initiatives
such as bond issues, charter amendments and the like. Listen, it's
tough enough for a native-born American to understand those
compact, confusing and convoluted paragraphs of explanation on the
ballot in English; imagine how difficult it is for a person whose
native tongue is not English to make an intelligent decision.
	   In Miami, where Spanish-speaking refugees arrive daily, children
are thrust into the public schools knowing only their native
tongue. To require them to speak English from day one is illogical,
and detrimental to their early advancement.
	   No laws short of totally unconstitutional edicts are going to
make a Spanish-speaking person in this country stop speaking
Spanish. Experts say that a gradual evolution will take place and
that several generations from now, those of Spanish heritage will
be speaking English as well as Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan, two
populist advocates of monolingualism.
	   I won't be around any more to enjoy it, but at least my
great-grandchildren can then go through a Miami shopping mall
without thinking they're in Havana or Managua.
