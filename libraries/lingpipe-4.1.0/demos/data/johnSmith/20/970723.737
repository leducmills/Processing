	   Q: What was the name of the Greek who carried a lantern and was
looking for an honest man? , R.D.A., Fort Worth, Texas
	   A: That was Diogenes, a philosopher who died around 320 B.C.
Diogenes stressed self-sufficiency and the rejection of luxury, and
his teachings caused him to be sent into exile away from his
birthplace of Sinope, Paphlygonia.

lit lantern in broad daylight, other apocryphal stories are
associated with Diogenes.
	   He slept in public buildings, lived in poverty and begged for
food, according to Encyclopedia Britannica, and was strongly
anti-family. He believed that men and women should be promiscuous,
and that any resulting children should be raised by the community
instead of individual families.
