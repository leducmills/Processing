	   AUSTIN, Texas , Sen. David Sibley had one question for those
opposing his bill that would hold managed health care organizations
liable for medical decisions: What makes the managed care industry
so special?
	   After more than an hour of heated debate in the Texas Senate
Monday, Sibley said nobody had a good answer for why every industry
except managed care is held liable for its actions or inaction.
	   But he did get enough support to pass the bill out of the Senate
and set Texas on a road to leading other states in regulating the
managed health care industry. Texas would be the first state in the
nation to allow managed-care organizations to be sued for medical
malpractice.
	   ``What's so special that this industry should be treated
differently from everybody else?'' Sibley said, repeating the
question he posed several times in the debate. ``Banks make a
mistake, they can be held accountable. If a doctor makes a mistake,
he's held accountable. If a lawyer makes a mistake, he's held
accountable. If HMOs make a mistake they say, `We don't practice
medicine.'''
	   Sibley's bill would allow patients to sue health care providers
whose decisions resulted in their injury. For example, a patient
whose doctor prescribes back surgery but whose health maintenance
organization recommends physical therapy currently could not sue
the HMO for nerve damage caused by forgoing the surgery.
	   ``This bill is for Texans who are having to fight to get the
health care that they have paid for for years,'' said Sibley,
R-Waco, a lawyer and oral surgeon. ``While there are a number of
honorable HMOs operating in the marketplace, others seem more
concerned with protecting their bottom line than protecting the
health of their enrollees.''
	   Health maintenance organizations and other such plans generally
limit patients' choice of doctors, thus offering lower
out-of-pocket costs than patients get under traditional insurance.
They include a ``gatekeeper'' to coordinate treatment and determine
its medical necessity.
	   A spokeswoman for the Texas HMO Association said the industry is
already held responsible and opposes Sibley's bill.
	   ``In answer to his question, we are held accountable like every
other business,'' said Mona Taylor, a spokeswoman for the
association. ``But (Sibley) wants to hold us liable to a medical
malpractice standard and we don't think he should.''
	   Taylor said HMOs can be sued for breach of contract, deceptive
trade practices and tort claims arising from decisions about
coverage. But she said they do not make medical decisions.
	   However, in debate on the floor, Sibley repeated horror stories
he'd heard during committee hearings of patients dying or being
seriously injured because of HMO decisions.
	   In a Louisiana case, he said, the doctor of a pregnant woman who
had been hospitalized during her first pregnancy had recommended
she be hospitalized during the pregnancy of her second child.
	   Her HMO decided to treat her as an outpatient. The woman's baby
died before birth, and the woman almost died, Sibley said.
	   He said a Tarrant County woman ``went to the HMO and said `I've
got these headaches. I've had these seizures.' They said, `Anxiety
attacks.'''
	   Two years later, a brain scan found a tumor, Sibley told his
colleagues. The woman, Diane Caywood, died at age 49.
	   ``This bill is for Diane Caywood,'' Sibley said.
	   Senators who rose to spar with Sibley suffered verbal knockouts.
Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, said the bill would increase the price
of health insurance premiums.
	   Ogden, a former state representative and newcomer to the Senate,
was forced back to his seat, slightly red-faced, by Sibley's
retort. Sibley told Ogden that he should be prepared to back up his
assertions.
	   ``I don't know how it works on the floor of the House, but that
is patently untrue, senator,'' Sibley said.
	   Sen. Robert Duncan, R-Lubbock, suggested that Sibley's bill
amounted to ``throwing the baby out with the bath water'' because
it could stifle the marketplace.
	   Sibley retorted: ``I want them in the bath water with everyone
else. They make bad decisions and they can say, `Well, joke's on
you' or `Go sue the doctor, go sue the hospital' ... while we
(HMOs) walk out the door.''
	   Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, argued that the free market
would take care of HMOs that fail to provide quality care. Fraser,
a businessman whose company makes wooden pallets, said he would pay
a little more to make sure his 850 employees are getting quality
care.
	   Sibley said Fraser is more compassionate than many employers but
noted that an HMO's accountability should be no different than
Fraser's.
	   ``If one of your pallets caused injury to me, senator, you are
not immune from liability,'' Sibley said.
	   About 12 percent of Texans are enrolled in a managed care health
plan, Sibley said. But about half of those are covered by business
self-insurance plans with federal protection from lawsuits.
	   However, Tracy King of Texans for Quality Health Care, a
business-led coalition including managed-care groups, said Sibley's
bill could increase costs for all managed-care consumers.
	   Sibley's bill, which passed on a voice vote, now goes to the
House. It is likely to be heard in the House Insurance Committee,
where Rep. John Smithee, R-Amarillo, is chairman. Smithee could not
be immediately reached for comment.
