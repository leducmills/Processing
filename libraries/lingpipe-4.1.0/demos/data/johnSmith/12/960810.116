
	   KLADANJ, Bosnia-Herzegovina , They have patrolled around mass
graves, escaped injury from mines and a hundred other hazards, and
endured far too many crackly, late-night calls with wives who are
asking for a divorce.
	   But the soldiers in Company C are decidedly optimistic these
days: After nearly eight months in Bosnia, where a shaky peace has
so far stood, they see only one hurdle , though it may be a high
one , standing between them and coming home in a few months.
	   ``In my mind, our mission was to come here and separate the
factions , which we've done , let a free and organized election
take place and, after that, we're gone,'' said Larry Thomas, a
25-year-old staff sergeant from Alden, Minn., as he stepped from
his room into a warm, night-time rain to light a cigarette.
	   ``Of course,'' he added, ``if something happens with the
elections, we'll be here until God-knows-when.''
	   Over dinner recently, Sgt. Steven Strait, of Omaha, made a dry
prediction:
	   Should anything go wrong with the Sept. 14 national elections,
seen as crucial to the creation of a unified, multi-ethnic country
after years of civil war, ``We'll start decorating the Christmas
trees here. We'll be here for it.''
	   The 100 or so men in Charlie Company, 4th Battalion, 12th
Infantry, are trying hard not to allow themselves that thought.
	   After the signing in Paris last December of the Dayton peace
accord, they were the first Americans of the NATO-led peacekeeping
force to reach Bosnia with armored vehicles , their company has 14
Bradley fighting vehicles , for what was expected to be a one-year
assignment. And they were the first Americans to establish a camp
in Bosnian Serb territory.
	   The men of Charlie Company no longer live in tents or use empty
ammunition boxes in a frozen cornfield as latrines. In fact, they
are now served huge cooked dinners in a mess hall fitted with a
television and plastic carnations and staffed with, of all things
for an Army base, a woman who tells anyone she can that she used to
be a model in Sarajevo. Commemorative T-shirts are on sale in the
post exchange.
	   But even if life is much easier, they are jumping to leave. And
because they were the first in from their battalion, their
commander, Lt. Col. William F. Briscoe, says he wants them to be
the first out, as the U.S. armed forces in Bosnia shift from an
heavily armed presence to one primarily of military police.
	   Military officials have been vague about the date for a final
withdrawal, though officers here say they expect a large portion of
the soldiers to be here at least until the anniversary of the
Bosnian peacekeeping mission in mid-December.
	   If all goes well with the elections, though, Charlie Company
could leave as early as mid-October , which is soon but not quite
soon enough for them.
	   ``The horses smell the barn right now,'' said Clark D. Carr, the
battalion's chaplain, who knows perhaps better than anyone how
badly they want to leave.
	   There are signs of anticipation everywhere at Camp Demi, just
east of this Muslim-controlled town between Tuzla and Sarajevo
(Charlie Company moved here last month from its original camp on
the Serb side to the east, Camp Pat, which is being dismantled in
preparation for the withdrawal of the heavy armored units).
	   Thomas has already sent home his extreme-cold weather gear. Sgt.
John Smith, 24, of Carmel, N.Y., in Putnam County, bought a 1997
Ford Probe during a recent home leave in Germany. Payments start in
December.
	   Pvt. 1st Class Daniel Kline, who is 20 and from Niagara Falls,
N.Y., has gone on a spending spree by catalogue with all the money
he has saved here. He has bought a distortion pedal, a wah-wah
pedal, something called a grunge pedal and a $500 amplifier for the
guitar he built himself. When he returns, he will have to figure
out how to play it.
	   ``My problem is,'' he said, ``I'm tone deaf.''
	   Even if the mood seems light these days, beneath the green hills
that surround the camps, it has been a long, hard, at times tense
and at times excruciatingly boring stay here in Bosnia for Charlie
Company.
	   In February, one Bradley crew hit an anti-personnel mine on a
mountain road in the zone of separation between the Bosnian Serbs
and Muslim-Croat territory, but no one was hurt. Farther down the
road, though, was an anti-tank mine they never would have seen had
it not been for the first explosion.
	   In general, the men say they feel like they are in prison , a
word Colonel Briscoe himself has used to describe his men's
circumstances here , because they cannot leave the camps, talk to
locals or even go to the latrine without their flak vests, helmets,
full uniforms and M-16 rifles (the last regulation has been eased
recently at some other camps).
	   ``I know I'm in the Army but when you have to wear combat boots
every day, you get tired of it,'' said Sgt. Stephen Kessler, 32,
from Seattle and a normally stoic veteran of the Persian Gulf war.
``I miss my family. Your life is put on hold.''
	   And then there have been the extraordinary pressures on the
men's marriages. In the more than 1,000 soldiers he ministers to,
Chaplain Carr estimated that, for about two months, he was seeing a
dozen people a day about serious marital problems.
	   In Strait's platoon of 30 men alone, there are six divorces
pending, and their stories represent an incalculable cost of the
mission here: The company's one casualty occurred in May when Spc.
Hector Rodriguez of Joliet, Ill., in despair over a crumbling
marriage, tied a string through the trigger guard of a machine gun,
tied the end to a nail and then pulled, wounding himself in the
stomach as he sat in a sandbag bunker.
