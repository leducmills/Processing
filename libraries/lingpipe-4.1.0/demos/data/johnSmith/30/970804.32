

	   ATHENS , Moments after his victory at the US Nationals, Maurice
Greene vowed to take on the burden of returning American sprinters
to glory.
	   Sunday night, Greene proved to be a man of his many words,
becoming the first American since Carl Lewis in 1991 to call
himself 100-meter world champion. While not delivering the
predicted world record on a surprisingly cool summer night,
Greene's 9.86 equaled Lewis' World Championships mark.
	   ``I ran the fastest time of my life. I just can't say anything
else at this time, I'm so amazed,'' said the usually loquacious
Greene at a packed news conference.
	   Donovan Bailey (9.91), the Olympic gold medalist and
world-record holder, was second, while American Tim Montgomery
(9.94) clipped Olympic silver medalist Frank Fredericks for third.
Ato Boldon (10.02), the fast-est man this year entering the meet,
struggled in at fifth.
	   Greene's victory came less than 30 minutes after Marion Jones,
newly graduated from the basketball court at North Carolina,
claimed the women's 100-meter crown that seemed her destiny since
the former high school phenom from California stormed back into the
sport last spring. Her 10.83 lowered her personal best by a
whopping 7/100ths of a second.
	   The dual 100-meter victories were the first in a major
international championship since the 1968 Olympic Games, when Jim
Hines and Wyomia Tyus both brought home gold from Mexico City.
	   The race got off to a rough start, which may have cost Merlene
Ottey, the Olympic silver-medalist from Jamaica, dearly. Apparently
not hearing the false-start signal, she ran full out for 50 meters
before finally stopping perhaps 20 meters from the finish line. Her
long walk back, agonizingly slow, only brought her to an eventual
seventh-place finish.
	   The finish wasn't much smoother. Although Jones led
wire-to-wire, runner-up Zhanna Pintussevich (10.85) of Ukraine
inadvertently stole her victory lap. ``At first I thought I'd won,
and I was so happy,'' Jones explained. ``But when I saw her
celebrating, I thought I hadn't won, but I was not so
disappointed.''
	   Once Jones, 21, saw her American teammates celebrating in the
stands, she leapt in the air when she realized the victory was
indeed hers. ``When I saw her celebrating, it put a little bit of
doubt in my mind,'' Jones admitted.
	   Jones, who still owns the US high school record for 200 meters,
concentrated on basketball at North Carolina, starting at point
guard for the 1994 national championship Tar Heels. It wasn't until
hoop season ended this spring that she turned her full attention
back to track and field. She also will compete in the long jump
later this week.
	   ``I knew I'd come back,'' she said. ``I knew this could happen.
I just didn't think it would be this soon.''
	   Greene's rise has been equally swift. Just last summer, he
failed to make the final of the Olympic Trials. Now, he and Bailey
are going at it eye-to-eye, which they did literally in their
semifinal when the Canadian turned to glare at him 5 meters before
the finish line as if to say ``Yes, this is how fast you have to
run to beat me.'' Greene met his stare, and the stage was set for
the final.
	   ``Why come in and settle for second or third?'' Greene said.
``Defeat doesn't taste as good as victory.''
	   Bailey would agree. ``I started to doubt myself, almost,
yesterday,'' he confessed, reflecting on his subpar results in the
early rounds. After repeating that he hasn't been feeling well for
weeks, the ill-at-ease runner-up added: ``I'm not going to make
excuses. It's Maurice's day.''
	   Greene, who never competed at a four-year college, last fall
joined Boldon and Jon Drummond in the tough, trash-talking,
tight-knit training group of John Smith. ``I wasn't afraid,'' he
said. ``I knew I'd have to leave home sooner or later. I knew it
would take a coach like that to put me on top.'' Before the final,
Boldon told Greene because he was feeling ill, it was up to him to
bring the gold back to Los Angeles; at the finish line Boldon was
there to engulf Greene with an embrace that may have lasted longer
than the race itself.
	   Smith himself put a coda on the evening. ``I get tired of people
beating up on us,'' he said. ``Americans have established
themselves again as great sprinters.''
