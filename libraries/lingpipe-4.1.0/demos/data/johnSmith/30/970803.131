
	   ATHENS, Greece , As the men's and women's 100 meters unfolded
Sunday at the world track and field championships, it took about 20
seconds to resolve the question of what is wrong with American
sprinting. The answer was, absolutely nothing.
	   Maurice Greene of Kansas City, Kan., endured leg cramps and won
the men's 100 in 9.86 seconds, while Marion Jones of Los Angeles
persevered through an uncertain finish to win the women's 100 in
10.83 seconds.
	   Both times were personal bests and the fastest in the world this
year. Greene's victory over the Olympic champion and world
record-holder, Donovan Bailey of Canada, equaled the third-fastest
100 ever run.
	   Jones prevailed after Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine closed
threateningly in the final 20 meters. Pintussevich began a victory
lap, believing she had won the race. Upon seeing Jones' name on the
scoreboard, she dropped to her knees in disbelief. Actually,
Pintussevich had finished second in 10.85 seconds.
	   ``I thought I had it won on a lean, but with the celebration she
did, I had a couple doubts,'' Jones said. ``I looked in the stands
and saw some American teammates giving me the thumbs up; at that
moment I knew I had captured the gold.''
	   Sevatheda Fynes of the Bahamas took third in 11.03. Merlene
Ottey of Jamaica, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, finished
seventh in 11.29 seconds. She was apparently drained after she did
not hear a gun that signaled a false start and sprinted 50 meters
before she realized what had happened.
	   With Carl Lewis retiring and the American men having failed to
win a 100-meter medal at the 1995 world championships and the 1996
Olympics, many had predicted further decline for the United States
here.
	   Bailey, who set a world record of 9.84 seconds at the Atlanta
Olympics, was now the world's dominant sprinter. But Greene had
promised to carry American sprinting on his back, and he lugged
that responsibility across the finish line Sunday ahead of all
three 1996 Olympic medalists.
	   Bailey finished second in 9.91 seconds, while Tim Montgomery of
the United States finished a surprising third in 9.94 seconds.
Frank Fredericks of Namibia, the Olympic silver medalist, was
fourth in 9.95, while Ato Boldon of Trinidad, the Olympic bronze
medalist who appeared ready to win after running 9.87 seconds in
Saturday's quarterfinals, suffered leg cramps and finished fifth in
10.02.
	   Sprinting, like the stock market, is cyclical. After being down
for several years, American 100-meter runners are back on top.
	   ``Certain people to the north were talking about how they were
going to put us in our place,'' said Greene's coach, John Smith,
referring to Bailey and other Canadians. ``Maurice, like Carl Lewis
and the older ones, was bold enough to say, `You want us, come
check us.' We get tired of other people beating up on us. The
Americans established themselves again as great sprinters.''
	   Although American men and women won the 100 meters at the 1984
and 1988 Summer Olympics, three of those victories carried
asterisks. Lewis was awarded the gold in 1988 after Ben Johnson of
Canada was disqualified for steroid use, and the 1984 victories by
Lewis and Evelyn Ashford came during a Soviet boycott.
	   Sunday's dual victories by Greene, 23, and Jones, 21, were the
first achieved against the entire world by an American man and
woman since Jim Hines and Wyomia Tyus took gold medals at the 1968
Summer Olympics in Mexico City.
	   What made the accomplishments more remarkable was that a year
ago, Greene suffered a hamstring injury and did not even qualify
for the semifinals of the Olympic trials, while Jones was playing
basketball at the University of North Carolina. She has run many a
fast break as a point guard, but Sunday night gave a whole new
meaning to the term filling the lane.
	   A former prep sensation who made the 1992 Olympic relay team as
a high school junior, Jones won a national basketball championship
in 1994 as a freshman at North Carolina. A foot injury required
surgery a year ago and prevented her from attempting to qualify for
the Atlanta Games in track and field. But she quickly polished the
rust off her sprinting after completing her basketball career in
March.
	   Jones won the national 100-meter championship in June and has
now posted five of the top seven times in the world this year; her
personal best has dropped precipitously to 10.83 seconds from
11.14. She also owns the fastest 200 meters in the world this year,
22.16 seconds, but is not competing in the event in Athens.
	   Gail Devers, the two-time Olympic champion, did not qualify for
these world championships, and Gwen Torrence, the defending
100-meter world champion, withdrew because of injury. But they were
hardly missed as Jones dominated with her searing start and her
easy, muscular running style.
	   She has a chance to become the star of this meet by winning the
long jump and running a leg on the 4 x 100-meter relay on Saturday.
In the previous five world championships, the sprinter Marita Koch
of the former East Germany was the only woman to win three gold
medals in one meet.
	   ``This championship is the top of my list, and a lot higher than
my basketball career,'' Jones said. ``That was a great experience,
but this is tops. I am definitely here to stay for many years.''
	   Smith, who coaches Greene, predicted that Jones could eventually
run 10.5 in the 100 and 21.0 in the 200 and long jump 25 feet. ``If
she stays with it, she could be one of the greatest females to put
on a pair of shoes,'' Smith said.
	   While the United States swept the 100 meters, other Americans
did not fare so spectacularly Sunday. Derrick Adkins of Malverne,
N.Y., the 1996 Olympic champion in the 400-meter hurdles, finished
fifth in his heat and did not qualify for Monday's final.
	   Michael Johnson, the Olympic champion in the 400 meters, had not
raced in a month as he recovered from a strained quadriceps muscle,
and it was evident Sunday. He labored slightly through the first
round in 45.66 seconds, then started slowly and let up too soon in
the second round, finishing fourth in his heat in 45.39 and
qualifying 15th among 16 runners for Monday's semifinals.
	   In the men's 100, Greene ran a comfortable 10.32 in the first
round on Saturday, then posted one of the top series in history in
the remaining heats and the final , 9.90, 9.90 and 9.86.
	   A week and a half past his 23rd birthday, he has already equaled
the fastest time that Lewis ever ran. A year ago, that would have
seemed impossible. Greene's personal best was 10.08 seconds, and he
got no closer to the Olympics than his television set.
	   In September, he moved from Kansas to Los Angeles to train with
Smith and Boldon, a former collegiate sprint champion at UCLA.
Smith taught Greene to relax at the start and save some speed for
the finish. Boldon exposed him to watching sprint videotapes and to
speaking with audacious confidence.
	   In Sunday night's semifinal, Bailey, who had been bothered by a
sore back, a hamstring injury and leg cramps, recovered as he
invariably does and stared Greene down as they crossed the finish
line a hundredth of a second apart.
	   ``I'm back,'' Bailey jabbered. Another sprinter might have been
intimidated. Not Greene.
	   ``He's a young kid; you can't beat him up,'' Smith said.
	   In the final, Greene stepped from the blocks as a cramp set in,
reset himself and accelerated into an early lead that he did not
relinquish. Bailey got close, but he had no passing gear.
	   ``Look at him,'' Emanuel Hudson, who is Greene's manager, said
as he watched Bailey sit uncomfortably next to Greene at the
post-race news conference. ``It's killing him, sitting there and
having to listen to someone else talk. It's not his show.''
	   Instead, for the moment, a newcomer named Maurice Greene was the
fastest man in the world.
	   ``People said the U.S. had dropped down,'' Greene said.
``Someone had to take charge and say, `I'm going to put them back
on top.' I believe in my ability. I didn't want to settle for
second or third. They don't taste as good as victory.''
