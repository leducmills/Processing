	   LOS ANGELES , The Nike contract has run out. The TV camera crews
that surrounded him after big races are long gone. The autograph
seekers have disappeared.
	   Much has changed in the athletic life of Quincy Watts, the
former Taft High School track sensation who won two gold medals at
the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain.
	   After he finished a disappointing eighth in the 400 meters at
the U.S. Olympic Trials last summer, Watts contemplated retirement
at the still-youthful age of 25.
	   ``I had my two gold medals and had reached the pinnacle in my
sport,'' he said. ``I was frustrated with myself and frustrated
with my sport. It was the first time in my life I didn't know what
to do, who to turn to or where to go.''
	   Once the world's fastest 400-meter runner, Watts was stuck
watching TV last summer as Michael Johnson bettered his Olympic
record in Atlanta. Instead of feeling depressed, Watts felt
rejuvenated.
	   ``It showed me these guys aren't better than me,'' he said. ``I
thought to myself I don't want to be one of those guys who wishes
about getting another shot.''
	   Last September, Watts was reunited with the coach who helped
prepare him for Barcelona, UCLA assistant track coach John Smith.
The two had parted ways in 1994. Under Smith's guidance, Watts has
been training six days a week at UCLA's Drake Stadium. There are no
grand expectations. They just have committed to enjoying themselves
and seeing what hard work can produce.
	   ``I'm doing great now,'' Watts said. ``I have a good sense of
contentment in my heart. I don't put a lot of expectations on my
shoulders as far as pleasing myself. I try to help others, but I
want to be the best again.''
	   Smith said Watts was like a championship boxer knocked to the
canvas. The question was whether he'd get back up and keep getting
back up.
	   ``A lot of times the road to success is not a straight line,''
Smith said. ``Us coming back together makes it real sweet. We
needed to be away from each other in order to grow up so we both
can handle what we want to do.''
	   Former UCLA and USC coach Jim Bush, who directed Watts' training
last year, said he's glad Watts isn't ready to give up on track.
	   ``In my mind, he had better workouts (last year) than in '92,''
he said. ``But he didn't have enough hard races under his belt.
There's an awful lot of talent in that body. If anybody can get it
out of him, it's John. (Watts) just needs self-confidence. He was
down in the dumps.''
	   Watts had never failed in sports before. He was the fastest prep
runner in the state at Taft High. He went to USC and won the 1992
NCAA championship for 400 meters. Then he stunned the track world
with his Olympic-record time of 43.50.
	   He came back to the San Fernando Valley an American hero. He got
his Nike shoe contract, bought a house in Calabasas and seemed
destined to dominate his sport. But injuries and setbacks slowed
his progress. Finally, his collapse at the Olympic Trials last
summer left him wondering if his time had come and gone.
	   ``Track and field is a sport not for everybody,'' he said. ``You
have to love to run or be a track enthusiast. I had lost that love.
I got bored. I was wasting my talent. The world can be real cruel
sometimes. But if you can withstand your struggles and you can be
patient, then everything will work itself out. I thank God I had a
good family.''
	   Things are looking up for Watts. The two gold medals stolen in a
1993 robbery finally were replaced last year. He's healthy again.
His weight has dropped from 235 pounds to a firm, fit 202. He knows
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, are a long way off, but
he'll be only 29 then. Michael Johnson was 28 last summer when he
won the 400 meters. Watts' first race this year will be the Mount
San Antonio College Relays on April 20.
	   A smiling Watts said, ``It's time to bring some beauty back to
the quarter.''
