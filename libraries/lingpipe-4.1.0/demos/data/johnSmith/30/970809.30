	   ATHENS, Greece , UCLA sprints coach John Smith, who helped found
and form HS International, jokingly refers to the club's acronym
HSI as ``handling speed intelligently.''
	   Whatever the meaning, the group's showing has rivaled the sprint
strength of any nation in the World Track and Field Championships.
	   Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago added a second gold medal of
the nine-day meet for HS International on Friday night, winning the
200 meters in a wind-aided 20.04 seconds.
	   Another HS International athlete, Jon Drummond of the U.S., was
seventh in 20.44. Five days earlier, HS International teammate
Maurice Greene of the United States won the 100.
	   The victory avenged a disappointing fifth-place finish in the
100 for Boldon, 24, who timed 9.87 seconds in the second round in
Athens to equal the fourth fastest time in history.
	   Boldon, the collegiate 100 record holder and 1996 NCAA champion
at UCLA who is staying two rooms down the hall from Greene, has
watched his teammate showered with an unending procession of
champagne and flowers the past week.
	   ``I had planned for two golds but you have to get what your body
gives to you,'' said Boldon, the Olympic bronze medalist in the 100
and 200 in the 1996 Olympics. ``It's been easier that it was
Maurice who won. When you train, you are full of adrenaline, but
then life throws you a stone. Inside I'm smiling, but I've been
humbled by the world championships.''
	   Boldon's time in the 200, aided by a 2.3 meter per second
crosswind, was well off his world-leading mark of 19.77 run in
Stuttgart in July. The effort, though, was enough for the 1996
Olympic bronze medalist to hold off Frankie Fredericks of Namibia.
Fredericks, the Olympic silver medalist, was second in 20.23 and
Georgios Panagiotopoulos of Greece was third in 20.32.
	   Boldon was even with Drummond, Panagiotopoulos and Ivan Garcia
of Cuba entering the final straightaway but opened a three-meter
lead with 50 to go. Boldon coasted to the tape, thrusting both arms
in celebration, and was immediately greeted by Greene, who jumped
out of the stands in street clothes to embrace his teammate.
	   ``Tonight's win was mostly guts because I had no energy,''
Boldon said. ``It was technically the worst race of the year, but
after what my body did to me in the 100, I knew it was going to be
the toughest race of the year. No one is going to remember the
time. They will remember who finished first.''
	   Marion Jones, winner of the 100, kept her hopes alive for a
second gold medal in the 400-meter relay semifinals.
	   Running the second leg, Jones teamed with Inger Miller, who also
finished fifth in the 200 in 22.52 Friday, Chryste Gaines and Gail
Devers to produce a world-leading 41.53, the third fastest time
ever behind East Germany's 41.37 in 1985 and the 41.49 by the U.S.
and Russia in the 1993 world championships.
	   ``When you get an opportunity to run with a talented group of
young ladies like this, it is really nice,'' said Jones, who will
also compete in the 400 relay and long jump finals tonight. ``I
definitely think the world record will come down. Today was a
conservative day to just get the baton around and get a feel for
each other.''
	   It was also a memorable night for Rich Kenah of the U.S. He
finished third in the 800 in a lifetime best 1:44.25.
	   Wilson Kepketer of Denmark, a Kenyan who was deprived of an
opportunity to compete in the 1996 Olympics while awaiting Danish
citizenship, led from the start to win in 1:43.38 with Norberto
Tellez of Cuba in second in 1:44.00.
	   Kepketer, who tied the world record of 1:41.72 in July, opened a
three-meter lead from the start after bursting through the 200 mark
in 23.47, 400 in 49.68 and 600 in 1:16.99 to run unchallenged.
	   Behind Kepketer were Tellez, Olympic champion Vebjoern Rodal of
Norway and Patrick Konchellah of Kenya battling for the remaining
medals. Kenah slipped past Konchellah on the inside line by a
hundredth of a second with Rodal in fifth in 1:44.53.
	   ``The pace was perfect for me,'' said Kenah, the world indoor
bronze medalist. ``In a slower race, it leaves everybody fresh for
the last 100 and I am not quite as fast as anyone else. When Wilson
went out, I breathed a sigh of relief because I knew it was going
to be a fast race.''
	   Kim Batten, Amy Acuff and Lawrence Johnson of the U.S. weren't
as fortunate as Kenah.
	   Batten, the world record holder and defending world champion in
the 400 hurdles, finished third in 53.52 after Zeha Bidouane of
Morocco came from 10 meters back to win in an African-record 52.97.
Olympic champion Deon Hemmings of Jamaica was second at 53.07 and
Tonja Buford-Baily of the U.S., the Olympic bronze medalist, was
sixth in 54.77.
	   Acuff, a two-time NCAA outdoor champion at UCLA and collegiate
record holder at 6 feet, 6 inches, did not qualify for the
12-competitor high jump final, clearing 6-3\ for the 13th best
mark.
	   Johnson, the American record-holder at 19-7{, no-heighted in the
pole vault qualifying, missing on three attempts at 18-4{ after
passing at 17-4\ and 17-10{.
