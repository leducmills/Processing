	   Johnson stumbled slightly at the start, but he quickly made up
the stagger on the Cuban Ivan Garcia in lane 4, running with his
familiar, efficient upright style. As he slingshot himself out of
the curve, Johnson held a slight lead over Fredericks, but he was
already in inexorable control of the race.
	   ``I saw a blue blur,'' said Boldon, who was in lane 6. ``I came
off the turn and he went by and I said, `There goes first.'''
	   The margin began to grow wider and wider, until Fredericks
resembled a defensive back who had just been beaten for a long
touchdown pass by pro football's fastest receiver. Johnson felt a
slight cramp at the finish, but it soon subsided. Otherwise, how
did it feel to run that fast?
	   ``It's an incredible thrill,'' said Johnson, 28, who lives in
Dallas. ``My dad bought me a go-cart when I was a kid. There a was
a big hill at the end of the street and I could make the go-cart go
fast if I went down that hill. It's the only thing that really
compares. So go get a go-cart and go down that hill, and you'll
know how it feels.''
	   What made Johnson's record victory so remarkable was that he was
running his eighth race in seven days. He will have a chance to win
a third gold medal Saturday as the anchor of the United States
4x400-meter relay. For four years, he has waited for this moment.
Perec, on the other hand, has considered the 200-400 double for
only about two months.
	   A native of Guadeloupe, Perec, 28, moved to France when she was
16 after a visiting French coach happened to time her in a
200-meter race. She has won the 400 meters at the past two Olympics
with a long, graceful stride that has earned her the nickname ``La
Gazelle'' from the French press.
	   Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, who had won the bronze medal three
times at 200 meters, sprung out of the blocks in lane 5, and had
the lead coming into the home stretch. But Perec used her 400-meter
endurance to begin closing in the final meters. About 10 meters
from the finish, she swooped past Ottey to win in 22.12 seconds.
	   Ottey took the silver in 22.24 seconds, and Mary Onyali of
Nigeria won the bronze in 22.38. The defending Olympic champion,
Gwen Torrence of the United States, did not qualify for the event
at the Olympic trials.
	   ``I'm like Michael Jordan in my own country,'' said Perec, who
now lives in Hollywood and trains at UCLA with coach John Smith.
``I can't walk in the streets without being recognized. I think
it's going to get worse. People will go crazy. That's why I went to
L.A.''
	   While Perec appears to have attempted her double as a lark,
Johnson has been under considerable pressure because he requested a
change in the Olympic schedule to accomodate his chances at winning
both the 200 and the 400.
	   ``There's never been so much pressure on me in my entire life,''
Johnson said. ``But as I've said, I always perform better under
pressure. I proved that tonight. I was afraid I wasn't going to get
that medal and make history. I like being afraid. I was nervous,
and I ran like I was nervous.''
	   Asked which meant more to him, the world record or the 200-400
double, he did not hesitate to answer, just as he had not hesitated
coming out of the curve.
	   ``The world record is the bonus on top,'' Johnson said. ``The
most important thing is making history. A lot of people can say, `I
hold a world record.' Nobody else can say, `I was the first person
in history to win the 200 and the 400.'''
