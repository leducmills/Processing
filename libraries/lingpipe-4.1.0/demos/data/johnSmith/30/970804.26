	   ATHENS, Greece , Marion Jones doesn't figure to make the switch
from track back to basketball soon. And Maurice Greene isn't
planning to head back to Kansas from California in the near future.
	   Jones and Greene, who burst onto the United States track and
field scene after making the changes this season, posted victories
in the women's and men's 100 meters in the World Championships of
Track and Field on Sunday night.
	   Jones held off Zhanna Pintussevich of the Ukraine by
two-hundredths of a second to win in 10.83 seconds. Greene,
overcoming painful groin spasms, defeated Olympic and world
champion Donovan Bailey of Canada to win in 9.86. Bailey was timed
in 9.91 and Tim Montgomery of the U.S. was third in 9.94.
	   For Jones, 21, a point guard on North Carolina's 1994 NCAA
champion basketball team and former Thousand Oaks High star,
Sunday's triumph culminated her return to track after nearly a
two-year layoff.
	   ``This is the top of my list by far than any of my basketball
career,'' said Jones. ``I am definitely here to stay for many
years.''
	   Jones ran faster than the 11.14 she had as a high school junior
in 1992 at the U.S. championships. After overcoming foot injuries,
she shaved nearly a tenth of a second off her previous best of
10.90 in Sunday's final to move into a tie for fifth on the
all-time U.S. list.
	   ``This hasn't really hit me and I doubt it will until the end of
the week,'' said Jones, who will also compete in the long jump and
the 400-meter relay. ``Everything is fun and games now that the 100
is done. The pressure is off and I can concentrate on some of the
funner events I enjoy competing in.''
	   Greene, 23, moved from Kansas to Irvine last September to train
under UCLA sprints coach John Smith. He trains with Ato Boldon, Jon
Drummond, Marie Jose-Perec. Boldon, considered one of the pre-race
favorites Sunday after clocking 9.86 in the second round, was a
disappointing fifth in 10.02.
	   Boldon and Greene embraced at the finish and Drummond raced on
to the track to congratulate his training partner.
	   ``I just had to leave and go to John Smith, and what better
coach to go to?'' Greene said. ``He has produced athletes and shown
tremendous things of what he can do. I knew it would take a coach
like that to put me on top. I'm still learning each day. It's a
tough group and we push each other every day. Not everybody can
handle it.''
	   Greene became the first American World or Olympic gold medalist
in the 100 since Carl Lewis' victory in Tokyo in 1991. Greene has
knocked more than two tenths off his previous best of 10.08 this
season to move into a tie for third on the all-time world list at
9.86 and only two-hundredths of a second off Bailey's world record
of 9.84.
	   ``I believed all the time since I arrived in September that I
could be the No.1 man in the world and today it all paid off,''
Greene said. ``I believe in my ability, and it's not that the U.S.
has died down. We have tremendous sprinters. Someone just has to
step up and take charge. I can improve on the end of my race to
break the world record. It is going to be gone very soon.''
	   In the men's 100, Greene opened a lead on Frank Fredericks of
Namibia at the midway point and held off a hard-charging Bailey in
the final 10 meters.
	   ``I broke apart technically,'' said Bailey, who said he has lost
14 pounds because of injury and illness. ``I was pretty weak in
practice. I am one of those people where it is not my nature to lie
down. I'm not going to make excuses for why I lost. It doesn't
matter what I went through.''
	   Jones endured a peculiar start and finish to capture the women's
100 in her first world-championship appearance.
	   Jones, who held a slight lead at 70 meters, along with
Pintussevich dipped at the finish. Pintussevich, thinking she had
won, sprinted off on a victory lap pursued by photographers until
it was announced Jones was the victor.
	   Jones, standing at the finish staring at a replay on the video
scoreboard, raised her arms in triumph after the announcement and
set out for a victory lap of her own but was corralled by
officials.
	   ``Initially, I thought I had it on the lean,'' Jones said.
``With the celebration I had my doubts. I looked to the screen and
saw some of my fellow American teammates giving me the thumbs up.''
	   Five minutes earlier, the race was recalled for a false start by
Sevatheda Fynes of the Bahamas. Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, however,
did not hear the second gun and sprinted nearly 75 meters before
stopping. Ottey, noticeably shaken, took several minutes to walk
back to the starting line.
	   Ottey, 37, winner of an unprecedented 13 world championship
medals but still without a 100 victory, lagged out of the blocks on
the second start before finishing seventh in 11.28. Fynes was third
in a personal-best 11.03 and Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines of the
U.S. were fifth and eighth at 11.18 and 11.32, respectively.
