
	   ATHENS, Greece , It has been six years since that stunning,
humid night in Tokyo when Carl Lewis, Leroy Burrell and Dennis
Mitchell led an American sweep of the 100 meters at the world track
and field championships.
	   But that sweep represented the peak of American dominance in the
event and the beginning of a spiraling decline.
	   Lewis, who set a world record of 9.86 seconds that night, never
ran under 10 seconds again; now, his career is on a farewell tour,
a month from retirement.
	   Burrell seemed devastated by surpassing his own world record in
the race and still finishing second; he later regained the world
record at 9.85 seconds, but lost it again to injury and Donovan
Bailey of Canada. The next important race he enters will be the
marathon of law school.
	   Mitchell became the most consistent American sprinter at 100
meters, winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics and a
world ranking of No. 1 in 1994. But the Mean Green Machine blew a
gasket this season, failing to qualify for the 100-meter final at
the national championships last month in Indianapolis.
	   While Gail Devers, Gwen Torrence and now, Marion Jones, have
kept American women at the top of the international list of
100-meter sprinters, American men failed to win a medal at either
the 1995 world championships or the 1996 Summer Olympics.
	   And when the world track and field championships open here on
Saturday, the top entrant from the United States will be Maurice
Greene, whose speed is matched only by his obscurity.
	   Greene, who turned 23 a week ago, owns the second-fastest time
in the world this year, 9.90 seconds, and the fourth-fastest time
ever run by an American, but outside of the increasingly
constricting track and field circles, he is a virtual unknown.
	   That could change if he wins Sunday's final on a hard, fast
track where a world record is possible and the field is expected to
include all three 1996 Olympic medalists: Bailey, the world
record-holder at 9.84 seconds, Frank Fredericks of Namibia and Ato
Boldon of Trinidad.
	   Greene may lack some important sprinting titles, but he does not
lack for confidence.
	   ``People are saying that American sprinting is down, that we're
not any good, that we're lost,'' Greene said. ``I don't feel that
way. It's just time for someone to step up and say, `I'm going to
carry American sprinting on my back.' I'm here to take
responsibility for American sprinting. I'm going to carry it as far
as I can.''

	   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

	   A three-time state champion at 100 and 200 meters from Schlagle
High School in Kansas City, Kan., the 5-foot-9-inch, 165-pound
Greene has traveled below the publicity radar for much of his
career.
	   Having failed to meet university entrance requirements, he
kicked around junior college briefly, then struck out on his own.
Unattached, and unknown, until the 1995 Texas Relays, when Greene
ran a wind-aided 9.88 seconds and defeated Lewis, the two-time
Olympic champion.
	   When asked later if he knew much about the fellow who had beaten
him, Lewis said, ``Who?''
	   Then Lewis added something prophetic. A 19- or 20-year-old
without collegiate experience might find it difficult to survive
the four rounds of competition at the national championships, world
championships or Olympics, he said. And meet promoters would have
no incentive to give an obscure sprinter a shot at top
international competition.
	   Greene qualified for the 1995 world championships, but he
disappeared early in the qualifying rounds, just as Lewis had
ruthlessly predicted.
	   ``It was a learning experience,'' Greene said. ``I wasn't
totally focused. I let a lot of things distract me.''
	   A year later, bothered by a hamstring pull, Greene failed to
make the final of the Olympic trials. After the Summer Games, he
switched coaches, moving from Kansas to Los Angeles to train with
John Smith, who coached Boldon to bronze medals at 100 and 200
meters in Atlanta and Marie-Jose Perec of France to gold medals at
200 and 400 meters.
	   ``I had a lot of growing up to do,'' Greene said. ``I was
impatient. Now I'm able to take my time and let it come.''
	   In a sort of sprinting taffy pull, Smith has stretched out
Greene's speed throughout the race. Before, he accelerated too
quickly at the start and had nothing left for the finish.
	   With Boldon, who owns the world's fastest time this season at
9.89 seconds and who owns a vast sprinting library, Greene has
watched more film than Siskel and Ebert.
	   The result: He has significantly lowered his personal best this
season by nearly two-tenths of a second, from 10.08 to 9.90 seconds
at last month's national championships.
	   ``He probably would have been running this fast earlier if he
had been in school,'' Smith said. ``But he hasn't been spoiled. He
hasn't been on a lot of fancy plane rides. He's hungry. And he's
not afraid to lay it on the line.''
	   His most impressive race, also run in 9.90 seconds, came earlier
this month on a sodden evening in Lausanne, Switzerland, where
Greene defeated Bailey, Fredericks, Boldon, the 1992 Olympic
champion Linford Christie and his American teammates, Tim
Montgomery and Mike Marsh. If not for the rain, Greene believes he
would have set a world record.
	   Excepting Christie, the same sprinters will reconvene Saturday
for the first two rounds of the world championships.
	   Bailey has been bothered by a stained hamstring tendon, but
Greene and others dismiss his poor-mouthing as mind games. Bailey
is certain to be ready for the final. And so, he believes, will be
Greene.
	   ``I'm going to run where it makes an imprint in someone's
mind,'' Greene said. ``When you get old you're going to say, `That
boy ran fast.' It's going to take sprinting to a whole other
level.''
