fraternity, but the mouth is certainly familiar.
	   ``I haven't run as fast as I can,'' said Greene this week,
looking ahead to Saturday's start of the sixth World Championships
of Track and Field. The first two rounds of the men's and women's
100 are among the day's highlights.
	   ``I've got to make an imprint in someone's mind,'' Greene said.
``When you get old, you'll say, `Man, that boy ran fast.' I'm going
to take sprinting to a new level.''
	   If he keeps up his pace, he just might. In less than two
seasons, the 22-year-old Kansas native has chopped 0.29 seconds off
his time, winning the US nationals last month in 9.90. That trails
only training partner Ato Boldon's 9.89 on the list of fastest
times in the world this year, and just two Americans , Leroy
Burrell and Carl Lewis , have ever run faster.
	   Among Greene's rivals for 100-meter gold will be Boldon, the
Olympic bronze medalist who runs for Trinidad and Tobago; Frank
Fredericks, silver medalist from Namibia (9.91 this season); US
teammates Tim Montgomery (9.94) and Mike Marsh (9.97); and Donovan
Bailey (9.97), the Olympic gold medalist and defending world
champion, who has been keeping a low profile here after saying last
week that he wasn't feeling well.
	   ``You show me a sprinter with no ego and no confidence, and I'll
show you a spectator who bought a ticket,'' said coach John Smith,
who began working with Greene last fall. ``Maurice knows how to
compete. On game day, he loves to match up against the best.''
	   Greene and Marion Jones, the former North Carolina point guard
who stormed through the nationals, winning the 100 in 10.97 and
beating Jackie Joyner-Kersee in the long jump, form the nucleus of
a team dominated by newcomers in what may be the start of a new
cycle in US track and field.
	   ``We are very young in the jumps and sprints, as well as the
middle distances,'' said Gary Winckler, coach of the women's team.
``So it will be a real interesting team.''
	   Other US men to watch include Michael Johnson and Antonio
Pettigrew at 400, Bob Kennedy at 5,000, Allen Johnson in the 110
hurdles, Derrick Adkins and Bryon Bronson in the 400 hurdles,
Charles Austin in the high jump, and Lawrence Johnson in the pole
vault.
	   On the women's side, keep an eye on Jones, Jearl Miles-Clark in
the 400, Regina Jacobs in the 1,500, Melissa Morrison in the 100
hurdles, and Kim Batten in the 400 hurdles.
	   Except for Kennedy, the fastest non-African ever at 3,000 and
5,000 meters, foreigners should dominate the distances. Daniel
Komen of Kenya has been unstoppable at 5,000, while Haile
Gebrselassie ran 26:31.32 last month in Oslo to break the world
record at 10,000 and looked fresh coming across the finish line.
	   Citing concerns about running on a track similar to the one in
Atlanta that left his feet bloodied, Gebrselassie had not planned
to run here. After reassurances, the Olympic gold medalist from
Ethiopia decided at the last minute to defend his world title,
albeit at a slower pace than Oslo.
	   ``At this weather and this championships, it is very difficult
to break records, especially for the long-distance runners,'' he
said. ``We concentrate on winning.''
	   Another late entrant is Marie-Jose Perec, the 200-400 double
gold winner in Atlanta, who has been struggling with a stress
fracture of the left tibia. Here she will try to repeat as champion
at 200. ``I will try my best, but apart from my enthusiasm, I have
no other weapons,'' said an undertrained Perec.
	   Several athletes with ties to the Boston area are here, although
Lynn Jennings is not among them. Jennings, of Newmarket, N.H., won
the 10,000 meters at the nationals but cited personal reasons in
withdrawing from the competition here. It is the first absence for
Jennings since the 10,000 was instituted in 1987. She will be
replaced by Gwyn Coogan, herself no stranger to New England.
	   Also here are Brian Baker (5,000), who moved to Dorchester last
year; Amy Rudolph (5,000) from Providence; and Julia Kirtland
(marathon) from South Harpswell, Maine. Boston Marathon fans will
want to keep tabs on Kenya's Tegla Loroupe and South Africans Elana
Meyer and Colleen DeReuck in the women's 10,000, as well as 1997
champion Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia. Three-time winner Cosmas Ndeti is
on the Kenyan team.
	   A record 200 countries have sent athletes to these world
championships, three more than participated last summer in Atlanta.
Through much of the world, the championships are front-page news,
and among athletes, a medal won here is regarded with no less
respect than one earned at the Olympic Games.
	   For the first time, prize money will be awarded: $60,000 for
first, $30,000 for second, $20,000 for third, and $100,000 for a
world record. Thus, if Greene or one of his competitors breaks the
world mark while winning the 100, he will take home $160,000 for
less than 9.84 seconds of work.
	   The championships will run through Aug. 10, culminating with the
relays.
