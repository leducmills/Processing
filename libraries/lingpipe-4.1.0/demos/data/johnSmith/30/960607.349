	   SWIMMING
	   More than half the U.S. Olympic team, as well as athletes from
countries as diverse as Egypt, Macedonia, Croatia and Thailand, are
competing in the Charlotte Ultra-Swim Meet, which continues today
through Sunday at the Mecklenburg Aquatic Center. Carlton Bruner of
Dunwoody and Eric Wunderlich of Atlanta are among the 24 U.S.
Olympians competing.
	   SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING
	   The U.S. team's training suffered a slight and definitely
unusual setback several weeks ago when 26-year-old Heather
Simmons-Carrasco came down with the chickenpox. The real problem
wasn't that this one adult team member hadn't ever had the
childhood malady, but rather that two of them hadn't. Because
teammate Tammy Cleland, 20, hasn't had chickenpox, Simmons-Carrasco
had to stay away from her and the pool for a week.
	   TABLE TENNIS
	   Todd Sweeris comes from the sport's royalty. His parents, Connie
and Dell Sweeris, are in the USA Table Tennis Hall of Fame and own
25 national titles between them. Todd, a 23-year- old junior at the
University of Maryland, used a powerful looping forehand smash to
qualify for the U.S. Olympic team in February. He finished third at
the trials and will play doubles at the Olympics with Jim Butler of
Augusta. Sweeris has been involved with the sport since age 2, when
he'd hit a ball up against the refrigerator door in his kitchen.
	   TEAM HANDBALL
	   Lisa Eagen, psychology major and softball star at Iowa State,
was going to head for grad school in 1993 before she was recruited
by the U.S. federation. ``My coach had played handball and I didn't
have a job yet,'' Eagen said. Later that year, she made the Olympic
Festival team. Now, she's an Olympian. After the Olympic Games,
she'll explore a possible career in Europe before returning to
train for the 2000 Games.
	   TENNIS
	   Those watching TV coverage of the French Open heard John McEnroe
give his two cents' worth on the format of Olympic tennis
competition. He doesn't like it, thus joining a list of former and
current players who would like to see changes. The International
Tennis Federation has heard the complaints and is considering
changes. What the players, led by Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and
Michael Chang, want to see is a team format like the Davis Cup or
Federation Cup.
	   TRACK AND FIELD
	   Former Olympic distance runner Vicki Huber, 29, could be one of
the top stories at the trials if she makes the U.S. team. Huber,
who competed in the '88 Seoul Olympics, quit running before the
1992 Games and 13 months ago gave birth to a child. She's qualified
in both the 1,500 and 5,000. . . . Now that he's completed his
eligibility at UCLA, Trinidad sprinter Ato Bolden is training in
Los Angeles with Jon Drummond. Both are coached by UCLA assistant
John Smith. Bolden's mother, Hope, works in Atlanta as a management
consultant.
