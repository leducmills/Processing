 ATLANTA , Ato Boldon is fast, brash and, after joining the Reebok
family earlier this month, loaded with cash.	   But the former actor who played Tiny Tim in a high school
production longs to be front and center on the world sprinting
stage.
	   So far, he is a background player.
	   ``I don't feel like people think I'm a presence like the guys
that have won at a high level,'' said Boldon, a Trinidad native who
just finished his senior season at UCLA. ``When I see Track and
Field News and they pick me fifth in the 100 and fourth in the 200,
I know I'm not a presence.
	   ``I want to leave Atlanta as one of four or five names that
(you'd hear) if somebody said, `Name the best sprinters in the
world.'''
	   Boldon's quest for 100-meter glory begins Friday, with the first
and second round. (The semifinals and finals are Saturday evening.)
To reach leading-man status, he must beat Namibia's Frankie
Fredericks, Great Britain's defending Olympic champion Linford
Christie and Canada's Donovan Bailey and Bruny Surin, plus
Americans Dennis Mitchell, Jon Drummond and Mike Marsh, a former
Bruin.
	   ``I disagreed with the notion that there will be an American
sweep,'' said Boldon, 22, whose rivalry with Mitchell is one notch
below boiling. ``They'll do well. They might win a medal, it could
even be a gold. But with myself, Frankie and Donovan, I don't see
how (a sweep) is possible.''
	   Boldon, who also has entered the 200, is a student of sprinting
history, and Tuesday at Reebok's news headquarters he discussed two
decades of 100-meter history as it pertains to his quest:
	   !arrow! A gold medal this quadrennial would be especially sweet
for, this being the 20th anniversary of countryman Hasely
Crawford's 100 meter victory in Montreal.
	   ``He has given me a couple of words of advice,'' Boldon said.
``He's very important to my career, because he's the only person
from Trinidad to accomplish what I'm trying to accomplish. I was 2
(in 1976) ... but a lot of the things I'm receiving are because of
what he did.''
	   !arrow! It's the eighth anniversary of Ben Johnson's
substance-abuse disgrace in Seoul. Like Boldon, Christie, Surin and
Bailey, Johnson is Carribbean-born (((desk, is this spelled
right??)) but raced for a first-world country. His rise and fall
sent shock waves through the islands, and through the track world.
	   ``I was a huge fan of his, and like everybody I was
disappointed,'' Boldon said. ``But Ben Johnson needed to be caught.
We needed a reversal from the direction track and field was
heading. It needed to be cleaner. Johnson was the sacrifical lamb,
but it was a sacrifice we needed.''
	   !arrow! It's the fourth anniversary of Boldon's bomb in
Barcelona. At age 18, he entered the 100 and 200 and was eliminated
in the first round of both.
	   ``It was not a very good performance, but of all the meets I've
been to, that's the one I wouldn't change,'' he said. ``It was a
very humbling experience. But it changed my attitude. After that,
every meet seems lesser, because I can say to myself that I've
already been to the biggest meet there is.''
	   The Boldon-Bailey-Christie-Surin quartet represents a shift in
sprinting dominance away from the Americans. Ironically, it began
in Seoul, site of Johnson's first place and subsequent disgrace.
(Christie was second to Carl Lewis that year.) Christie won in
Barcelona, with Fredericks second and Surin third.
	   Two lifestyle factors seem to account for the shift. One, Boldon
believes, is the fat-laden American diet. The second is climate:
with no winters, Carribean children are outside year round.
	   Boldon's coach, John Smith, is a Los Angeles native who attended
Fremont High and UCLA (1969-72). He believes the cyclical nature of
Carribean and American sprinting success is intertwined with supply
and demand rules that govern American scholastic sports.
	   When basketball, baseball and football rosters become saturated,
he says, athletes turn to other outlets, like track. When roster
demand rises, the next Willie Gault or Kenny Lofton grabs a bat or
ball, and Carribean sprinters step in to fill the void.
	   ``All the Carribean athletes that do well do so because they
train, live and compete in the United States, and I'm a good
example of that,'' said Boldon, who moved from Trinidad to New York
with his mother in 1988. ``The gap has closed. We've seen the
dominance the Americans displayed, and we adopted the American
formula.''
	   But many Carribean nations ramain years behind in facilities,
equipment and funding. For that reason Boldon began the Golden
Boldon Corporation, from which needy children can pay for
international competition and equipment.
	   ``Some kids don't have spikes. They don't have a coach. They
don't have a way to get to the stadium,'' Boldon said. ``The world
is in a recession, and Trinidad is a third-world country included
in that group. Morale is not good, but it would certainly be
boosted by a gold medal.''
