Greene became the 100-meter world champion, Ato Boldon has watched
and waited: watched Greene get smothered with attention and waited
for his chance to breathe more easily.
	   ``He got more flowers and champagne than most brides, I think,''
joked Boldon of his buddy and rival. He could afford to kid around
because last night Boldon won the 200 at the World Championships of
Track and Field. ``I knew I'd have to come in here and have a race
that was mostly guts, because I was certainly out of leg power.''
	   After eight races in seven days, Boldon ran a modest 20.04
seconds in winning the 200 after finishing a disappointing fifth in
the 100 last Saturday. He was the bronze medalist at both distances
in the 1996 Olympics. Namibia's Frank Fredericks (20.23) was a
familiar face in the runner-up spot , he was second in the 1995
world championships and silver medalist at 100 and 200 in Atlanta ,
while Claudinei da Silva of Brazil (20.26) was third. Jon Drummond
(20.44) came in seventh for the US.
	   On a busy night that featured seven finals within 90 minutes,
Boldon barely had time for a barechested victory lap before Wilson
Kipketer defended his 800-meter world title with a 1:43.38 effort,
well off the 1:41.73 he ran last month to tie Sebastian Coe's
16-year-old world record.
	   ``I was not expecting to go for a world record,'' said Kipketer,
a Kenyan who now runs for Denmark. ``I'm really tired of talking
about the world record.''
	   American Rich Kenah of Arlington, Va., was third in 1:44.25, a
personal best. ``I ran for second place,'' said Kenah, conceding
the title to Kipketer. ``I'm a place out of where I wanted to be,
but I'll take that.''
	   In other highlights, Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine won the
women's 200, denying Merlene Ottey her third straight world title
at the distance. Ottey, of Jamaica, has competed in all six world
championships dating back to 1983. Pintusevich, 25, was second here
to Marion Jones in the 100.
	   Little-known Nezha Bidouane of Morocco blew by Olympic gold
medalist Deon Hemmings of Jamaica and world record-holder Kim
Batten of the US to win the 400 hurdles.
	   Meanwhile, American record-holder Lawrence Johnson and Okkert
Brits of South Africa, one of the favorites, both failed to clear a
height in the qualifying round for the pole vault.
	   In their race, Boldon in Lane 3 and Drummond, running in the
disadvantageous Lane 1, pulled even with the leaders at 100 meters.
On the straightaway, Boldon pulled away, and with 50 meters
remaining, he had an insurmountable lead. Drummond , who also
trains with Boldon , faded in the last 30 meters as Fredericks came
on.
	   With 150 meters to go, Boldon recounted, ``I said, `This is the
moment.' I looked around, saw nobody, and said, `They're going to
have to come get me.' Then it was a photo op.''
	   Right after the race, Boldon cheerfully referred to his
performance as the slowest ever to win a world title. It wasn't: In
winning back-to-back championships in 1983 and '85, American Calvin
Smith ran 20.14 and 20.16.
	   ``I ran the first race of the year faster than this one,'' said
Boldon, who owns the fastest time in the world this year, 19.77.
``But history is not going to record that. History is just going to
record I ran the best on this day.''
	   History will also record that he replaces Michael Johnson as
world champion at the distance. But Johnson, who in Atlanta
annihilated the world record with his 19.32, ran only the 400 here.
	   Time, indeed, was not of the essence last night to Boldon, the
23-year-old from Trinidad and Tobago who has lived in the United
States for nine years, went to UCLA, and is coached by John Smith,
former world record-holder in the 440-yard dash. Since winning both
the 100 and 200 at the world junior championships in 1992, Boldon
has run consistently well, but not well enough to win. Coming here
off the fastest one-day sprint double in history (9.94/19.80)
earlier this season in Lausanne, he found expectations were high.
Then came the 100.
	   ``All of a sudden, it's like, `You can't win the big one,''' he
said of the buildup to last night. ``This was very important. I can
say it's the hardest thing I have had to do to date.''
	   Smith, asked if this meet saw the dawning of the Greene-Boldon
era, replied, ``I hope so. I hope these young men stay in and work
hard and get things done.''
	   The ebullient Boldon , who quipped after Johnson's stunning
performance in Atlanta, ``That wasn't a time; it sounds like my
dad's birthday'' , was more subdued last night, perhaps taking a
step toward that future.
	   ``If anything, I have been humbled by this entire world
championship experience,'' he said, referring in part to his
world-record predictions for himself in the 100. ``You have your
plans and you're going to come in and do 9.7 or 19.20. You come
here and life throws you a curve, and you have to rebound from
it.''
