	   LOS ANGELES , Like one of the up-tempo gospel songs he loves so
well, there is an uplifting air of effervescent enthusiasm to
sprinter Jon Drummond.
	   A broad smile is standard wear for America's No. 1 100-meter
man, whether he is on the track or at a concert singing with the
highly acclaimed gospel group Kirk Franklin & The Family.
	   ``I'm just a happy guy,'' said Drummond, 27, who will compete in
the 50-meter dash at Saturday's L.A. Invitational Track Meet.
	   Drummond's joys are many. And he doesn't mind sharing them.
	   ``He's very charismatic,'' said coach John Smith. ``He's the
kind of guy who enjoys himself and other people.''
	   Drummond said he is elated to be ranked No. 1 in the United
States and No. 4 in the world at 100 meters.
	   ``With all the sprinters we have in America, for me to be
recognized as the best , wow,'' Drummond said with typical
enthusiasm. ``And to be considered No. 4 in the world. ...''
	   Drummond's ascent to such heights has been gradual.
	   He won national junior college titles in the 100 and 200 at
Odessa Community College in Texas in 1987. In 1991, while competing
for Texas Christian, he won the 200 at the World University Games.
	   His surge to international prominence began with a fourth-place
finish in the 100 at the 1993 U.S. Track and Field Championships,
earning him a spot on the U.S. 400-meter relay team that won the
gold medal and tied the world record (37.40 seconds) at the World
Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.
	   He has been world-ranked at 100 meters ever since, fifth in
1993, third in 1994 and fourth in 1995.
	   Drummond's music career has seen similar success.
	   The son of a Philadelphia minister, he got involved with a local
gospel group while a student at Texas Christian.
	   ``Being a pastor's kid, you grow up loving certain things about
the church,'' he said, citing his affinity for music. ``It's
basically something I grew up with.''
	   His group grew to national prominence over the years, and its
hit ``Why We Sing'' was No. 1 on the Billboard gospel chart and won
Gospel Song of the Year honors in 1993.
	   ``They're one of the top-selling gospel groups in America,''
said Drummond's manager, Emmanuel Hudson. ``Anyone who pays
attention at all to gospel music knows who they are.''
	   Drummond's athletic career prevents him from making all of the
group's concerts. And in this Olympic year, he will concentrate
even more heavily on his running.
	   ``The ultimate goal is to stand on that podium,'' said Drummond,
who hopes to make the U.S. team in the 100 and 200. ``If I run a
personal best, I'll be satisfied, but my goal is to be a gold
medalist.''
	   Drummond's plan for the L.A. Invitational is to work on his
start by running the 50.
	   ``We're putting together the first part of his race,'' Smith
said. ``His main asset is he has extremely good ability to
accelerate very early. We don't want to lose that.''
	   Saturday's meet will be Drummond's second of the year after
being sidelined early by illness and injury.
	   While in Texas to serve as Kirk Franklin's best man, Drummond
was hospitalized with what doctors thought was meningitis. But
after a single day in bed, he was well again as suddenly as he had
become ill. Unfortunately, he missed the wedding.
	   Earlier this month, he hurt his knee while lifting weights but
seemed well after just a few weeks.
	   ``I believe in divine healing,'' said the deeply religious
Drummond. ``And I think I've experienced it twice this year.''
	   Drummond dismisses his first meet of the season , a fifth-place
finish at 60 meters in New York , as a prelude to what he expects
to be his best season.
	   ``You don't expect great things to happen in the first race of
the season,'' he said. ``You're basically just testing the motor.''
	   He'll be testing it again Saturday. And he wants meet fans to
take a few pages from his philosophy: smile and have fun.
	   Drummond said his effusive style is part his nature and part a
way to get closer to the fans.
	   ``It gives them a sense of being part of the race,'' he said.
``When they know I'm racing, they should come expecting to have a
good time.''
	   Why not? Drummond certainly is.
