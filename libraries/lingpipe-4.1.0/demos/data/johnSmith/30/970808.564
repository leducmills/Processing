
	   ATHENS, Greece , When he finished fifth at 100 meters last
Sunday, Ato Boldon of Trinidad had to live with the world champion
being a close friend and training partner, Maurice Greene.
	   ``He was two doors down, and he got more flowers and Champagne
than most brides,'' Boldon said.
	   A former national champion at UCLA who began his career at
Jamaica High in Queens, N.Y., Boldon is a chatty, effervescent sort
who has talked incessantly about becoming the future of sprinting.
Until Friday night, when he won a world title at 200 meters in
20.04 seconds, his deeds have seldom supported his words.
	   Boldon won bronze medals at 100 and 200 meters at the Atlanta
Olympics, finishing third while Donovan Bailey and Michael Johnson
respectively won with world records.
	   Last Saturday, Boldon ran 9.87 seconds in the 100-meter
quarterfinals, then the fastest time in the world this year. A day
later, he suffered leg cramps, and perhaps strained confidence, and
finished fifth in 10.02 while Greene ran a personal best of 9.86
seconds to win the world title.
	   ``After the 100, it's like, `You can't win the big one,'''
Boldon, 23, said after Friday night's victory. ``This was very
important.''
	   The 200 time was slow, despite a tailwind, and the race suffered
from anticlimax because Johnson, the world record-holder at 19.32
seconds, was not entered. Boldon did not come anywhere close to the
19.77 he ran last month, which is the fastest time in the world
this year.
	   Still, he validated his career, winning a world title in his
eighth race over the past seven days. His legs felt lifeless after
so many rounds, but they finally caught up with his confidence.
Frank Fredericks of Namibia finished second in 20.23 seconds, and
Claudinei da Silva of Brazil took third in 20.26.
	   ``I knew I'd have to come in here and run mostly on guts,
because I had definitely run out of leg power,'' Boldon said.
	   He was not alone in wishing for more energy from a reserve tank
Friday night. Wilson Kipketer, a Kenyan who runs for Denmark,
attempted to break the world record he shares at 800 meters,
passing 200 meters in 23.41 seconds and 400 meters in 49.68.
	   His 600-meter split was 1:16.99, but at that point Kipketer
appeared bothered by a crosswind, the lack of a pace setter and
fatigue from running his fourth round in five days. He won
comfortably in 1 minute 43.38 seconds, but he was well off the
world record of 1:41.73 that he shares with Sebastian Coe of
Britain.
	   Rich Kenah of Arlington, Va., tucked into Kipketer's slipstream
and, with a lean at the tape, won a bronze medal in 1:44.25, his
career best. Norberto Tellez of Cuba took the silver medal in
1:44.0.
	   A year ago, after finishing fourth at the Olympic trials, Kenah
began sending out resumes; he thought it was time to stop running
and start using his business degree from Georgetown University.
	   Partly on the advice of Craig Masback, a former top miler who is
now executive director of USA Track and Field, Kenah decided to
stick with running. He won a bronze at the world indoor
championships in March and followed Friday night with a bronze at
the outdoor world championships, relying on the fast start to wear
down the finishing kicks of his competitors.
	   ``We knew we were all running for the silver medal,'' said
Kenah, who is 27. ``When Wilson went out, I knew I'd have a better
shot.''
	   Kim Batten of Rochester, N.Y., had intended to challenge her
world record of 52.61 seconds in the women's 400-meter hurdles, but
she and the Olympic champion, Deon Hemmings of Jamaica, were
surprised by the fast-closing Nezha Bidouane of Morocco. Five
meters behind Hemmings after the ninth of 10 hurdles, Bidouane made
a fierce charge at the finish to win in 52.97 seconds, a personal
best. Hemmings took the silver in 53.09 and Batten, the 1995 world
champion, settled for the bronze in 53.52.
	   Lawrence Johnson of the United States experienced even more
disappointment when he failed to clear a height in the pole vault
qualifying. In the semifinal of the women's 4x100-meter relay, the
American team of Chryste Gaines, Marion Jones, Inger Miller and
Gail Devers ran 41.52 seconds, just .15 off the world record.
Yoelvis Quesada of Cuba won the men's triple jump at 58 feet 6}
inches. Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine, who reacted prematurely
after the 100 meters, thinking she had defeated Jones, celebrated
legitimately Friday night by winning the women's 200 in 22.32
seconds.
	   Boldon, too, could celebrate with Greene, who trains with him
and Coach John Smith in Los Angeles. At 14, Boldon moved from
Trinidad to New York after his parents divorced. He was spotted
playing soccer by Joe Trupiano, the Jamaica High track coach.
Boldon credits his searing starts partly to a drill that Trupiano
employed, having his runners lie down in the school hallways until
they heard a paper clip or an eraser drop. The wait could last from
seconds to minutes, Boldon said.
	   A false start may have cost him the 100-meter gold medal in
Atlanta, but tonight, Boldon started perfectly, catching up to
Fredericks in about 10 strides. At 115 meters, Boldon made another
move and Fredericks was gone, along with Boldon's reputation of
being unable to win the big one.
	   ``He had to win this,'' Smith said. ``He had put a lot of
pressure on himself.''
