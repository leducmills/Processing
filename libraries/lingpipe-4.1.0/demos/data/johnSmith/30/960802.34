	   ATLANTA , Alas, there is someone out there who can beat Michael
Johnson to the record book.
	   Marie-Jose Perec, she of the California mailing address and the
noticeably French-cut running briefs, did it by about 15 minutes.
	   With the 400-meter gold medal already in her valise, same as
Michael, Perec overtook Jamaica's Merlene Ottey in the final 10
meters last night and added the Olympic 200-meter title to her
burgeoning collection.
	   In so doing, Perec became the second woman to win both the 200
and 400 in the same Olympics. American Valerie Brisco-Hooks
performed the feat against a boycott-thinned field at the 1984 Los
Angeles Games.
	   ``I am still shivering,'' Perec said last night. ``The dream has
come true. To me it was quite clear that I had to do it now or
never. I was ready to die on the track today.''
	   Must be a French thing.
	   Born in Basse Terre, France, Perec trained in California under
coach John Smith. She has caused a mini-stir at Olympic Stadium
this week with both her running , and her running shorts. For the
record, none of us have noticed anything special about Johnson's
shorts, but he does insist upon wearing a gaudy pair of gold lame
sprint spikes.
	   Ottey is amassing quite a collection of her own. Ottey now has
200-meter bronze medals from the 1980, 1984, 1992 and 1996
Olympics.
	   ``I admire Merlene as a wonderful woman and a great athlete,''
Perec said, graciously. ``Before the race I knew that if you beat
her, yours is a certain gold.''
	   Johnson later paid tribute to Perec's performance. He said he
had watched it on TV before the men's 200 field had to report to
the start.
	   ``I'm a fan of the sport as well,'' Johnson said. ``I was happy
to see another person double as well.''
CRACKDOWN ON PINS
	   The passion for souvenir pins at these Olympic Games knows no
bounds. Even tardy shuttle-bus drivers shamelessly beg us for pins.
	   In their never-ending quest, however, to preserve liberty,
economy and the American way, Atlanta organizers (ACOG) have
dispatched their self-appointed licensing police to crack down on
illegal pins.
	   Those would be any souvenir pins that have used the word
``Olympic,'' ``Olympics,'' ``Atlanta Games'' or anything similar
without paying a high bounty to the Atlanta organizing committee. I
think the figure is 80 percent of your gross income, payable
through age 60. Just kidding.
	   But one recent case has underlined ACOG's silliness with this.
	   The Varsity, a local icon of burgers, chili-cheese dogs and
french fries so greasy they could slide straight to your
cardiologist's waiting room, has produced a series of somewhat
Olympic-related pins. They shows the Varsity's restaurant logo and
a food item. Pin No.5 showed the onion rings.
	   But ACOG saw something else. They ordered all the Varsity pins
confiscated because they felt the onion rings looked ``far too
similar'' to the familiar rings of the Olympic Games.
	   The Varsity management was flabbergasted. But they complied. And
so few of the original onion-rings pins had been sold that they now
carry a price tag on the open market of $700 and upward.
AGASSI CATCHES SPIRIT
	   Loyal patriot and crowd-pleaser Andre Agassi somehow survived a
medley of break points yesterday, won the first set, and went on to
survive his quarterfinal Olympic tennis showdown with India's
Leander Paes.
	   Paes, a late entry into the Olympic singles draw, came into the
match ranked 127th in the world. Agassi, meanwhile, has the
tournament's No.1 seed and has been a clear crowd favorite at the
Stone Mountain Tennis Center.
	   Agassi will play for the men's gold medal tomorrow afternoon.
	   ``It would be unbelievable to win a gold medal,'' Agassi said.
``I couldn't put into words what it would mean for the United
States, just to see that number of how many medals won go up and
knowing you were part of it.
	   ``But it really boils down to going out there and giving it
everything you have. That's what these Games represent.''
