
	   ATHENS, Greece , When the world track and field championships
concluded on Sunday, Marion Jones of Los Angeles had distinguished
herself as the only winner of two gold medals.
	   She won the 100 meters in 10.83 seconds, fastest in the world
this year, and she ran the second leg on the American 4x100-relay
team that delivered the second-fastest performance of all time,
41.47 seconds. But she didn't compete in what many feel is her best
event, the 200 meters.
	   ``It's my favorite event,'' she said after winning the 100.
``Unfortunately, I didn't have enough base training to be able to
compete in it here.''
	   Had she run the 200 in Athens, Jones, 21, likely would have
added a third gold medal. She ran 22.16 seconds last month, the
fastest time in the world this year and considerably faster than
the 22.32 that Zhanna Pintussevich of Ukraine ran in winning the
200 last Friday at the world championships.
	   The two will undoubtedly meet several times as the European
season continues. Wednesday, at a meet in Zurich, Switzerland,
Jones plans to run both the 100 and 200. Her goal for the remainder
of the season is to run 10.7 in the 100, and a sub-22 200.
	   John Smith, who coached Maurice Greene to a world title at 100
meters and Ato Boldon to the 200-meter gold medal, said he believed
that Jones could eventually run 10.5 in the 100 and 21.0 in the
200, which would threaten one of Florence Griffith-Joyner's world
records, 10.49 seconds for the 100, and shatter her other world
record, 21.34 for the 200.
	   ``It will definitely stand for a couple more years,'' Jones said
of FloJo's 100-meter world record. ``I hope I'm the person who can
break it. It would have to be a perfect day, a perfect race, but I
feel I can be that person. Hopefully in a couple of years I will be
able to say I'm the fastest woman who ever lived.''
	   For at least five years, her speed has been evident on a
national level. Jones owns the fastest 200 meters ever run by a
high school sprinter, 22.58 seconds, and her 11.14 in the 100 is
the second-fastest prep time ever recorded. But what made her
accomplishments so startling this season is that the most
compelling running and jumping that Jones has done over the past
four years has been as a point guard on the North Carolina
basketball team.
	   At the national track and field championships in June, Jones won
the 100 and the long jump after only 13 weeks of concentrated
training with her coach, Trevor Graham. With two professional
women's basketball leagues operating now, Jones could have a
professional hoops career if she so desired. But she has said
repeatedly that her first love is track and field.
	   ``I'm not going to say forever,'' Jones said when asked how long
she would compete in track and field. ``But definitely several more
years. I want to achieve the things I've dreamed all my life. I
want to be world champion, an Olympic gold medalist and a
world-record holder. I plan to be around until I achieve all
those.''
	   Her two-sport versatility has brought inevitable comparisons to
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, a former basketball player at UCLA who has
become perhaps the greatest female athlete of all time with two
Olympic titles in the heptathlon and one in the long jump. It was
Joyner-Kersee whom Jones defeated in the long jump at the national
championships in June.
	   But it was Joyner-Kersee, the 1988 Olympic champion and a
two-time bronze medalist, who battled gamely, if futilely, for a
long-jump medal on Saturday at the world championships, while Jones
could not coordinate her speed and her approach to the takeoff
board. She did not qualify for the final round of three jumps after
leaping 21-9, a foot shorter than she jumped at the national
championships.
	   ``I'm very disappointed,'' Jones said. ``My technique is not
even close to where it's supposed to be. The last few weeks, I
focused so much on the 100, that I didn't focus much on the long
jump. I haven't even scratched the surface. Jackie pulled me aside
and said, `I'd love to come to North Carolina and show you some
technique.' I said, `Please, I could really use the help.' ''
