talked about the track almost as much as they talked about their
opponents, if not quite as much as they talked about themselves.
And with the 100-meter qualifying rounds getting under way Friday,
``fast track'' talk is back.
	   For sprinters, a track surface is no small factor in
performances that are measured in 1,000ths of a second, or less.
Because of the heat and humidity, few observers expect world-record
times in distance races at these Games, but sprinters love the heat
 it keeps their muscles loose , and they will be stepping on a
track that's as hot as the weather.
	   The Atlanta Olympic organizing committee ``asked if we could
build them a fast track and that's what we did,'' said Joe
Hoekstra, project manager of Mondo tracks in Atlanta. ``We did
everything we could and stay within the legal limits.''
	   Many running surfaces are made of polyurethane, but the Olympic
track, a Sportflex Super X, is composed of rubber vulcanized under
high pressure and high temperature. The rubber sheets, of which the
top half is hard while the bottom half is softer, for shock
absorption, are then glued to asphalt in strips the exact width of
each lane.
	   According to Hoekstra, the Olympic track has a minimum force
reduction , or shock absorption , rate averaging 38 percent, with
some spots a bit less. (By comparison, the rating for a concrete
floor would be zero.) The International Amateur Athletic
Federation, the governing body of track and field, has set the
minimum at 35 percent. If a track is found to be under that
minimum, any records set on it would be disallowed.
	   When runners indent the track with their body weight, it
recovers quickly. On softer tracks, athletes sink into the material
farther and lose time. According to Hoekstra, ``The number of
strides in 100 meters (on this track) is roughly 1 to 1 1/2 strides
less for the same distance. That is because the athlete doesn't
lose as much energy in deflecting the material.
	   ``It's like stepping on an elastic band.''
	   After the international Grand Prix track meet in May that opened
the stadium, US miler Steve Holman rhapsodized: ``The track is
extremely fast. They say it is one of the fastest in the world and
after running on it, I believe it.''
	   ``It's very fast,'' verified US steeplechaser Marc Davis during
the Olympic Trials. ``It's a European-style track which everybody
wants to run on. Nobody wants to train on it very much, but we
definitely like to race on it.''
	   Practice tracks are made of more resilient materials, to lessen
the impact on an athlete's legs. Because of the minimal shock
absorption on the Olympic track, substantial energy is returned up
into the muscles of the legs. Cramping is a likely result. Indeed,
virtually every sprinter in the 100-meter final at the Olympic
Trials was hit by leg cramps at , if not before , the end of the
race, although dehydration and electrolyte depletion that began in
the preliminary rounds shares much of the blame.
	   With each stride, the impact on a sprinter's legs is about four
to five times his or her body weight. So, a 180-pound sprinter
could be landing with a force of 900 pounds each time a foot hits
the track. ``The force has got to be dissipated somewhere,''
explained Cliff Rovelto, head track coach at Kansas State. ``If
it's not going into the track, it's going into the body.''
	   Clark-Atlanta University will inherit the track after the
Olympic Stadium is retrofitted into a baseball park for the
now-neighboring Atlanta Braves. Richard Cosby, director of
athletics there, said of the unforgiving track surface being used
for regular workouts, ``We do have some concern about that, but we
haven't given a lot of study'' to the ramifications. ``Hopefully we
could find a shoe that would give them some relief.''
	   John Smith, who coaches 100-meter Olympians Jon Drummond and Ato
Boldan, said, ``This track is going to be very interesting. Certain
runners run well on certain surface. People who don't spend a lot
of time on their feet will do well.'' He put Frank Fredericks and
Drummond on that list, while predicting that power runners such as
Donovan Bailey could have problems because ``the rebound from the
track shakes your legs and will probably cause you to cramp.''
	   Drummond said after the trials, ``It's the best to run on. But
because we're going to be running rounds, it's taxing to the body.
Personally speaking, I love it. It's fast.''
	   Mary Slaney, who made the Olympic team at 5,000 meters and also
ran two rounds of the 1,500, agrees with the ``taxing'' part. ``For
distance runners it's a little bit different. I think it's more of
a sprint track than a distance track. As far as the distance events
go, anything above a 1,500 and 800 I heard from the athletes
running those distances, it does take a toll on your legs. From my
experience at the trials, you don't notice it while you're doing it
but each day that goes on that you run on the track, it takes more
out. I haven't experienced that on other tracks that are a little
bit softer.''
	   Slaney, who at 38 has been competing on tracks for more than 24
years, thinks the discomfort will show up on the clock. ``The fact
that it is a hard, fast track could mean extremely fast spring
times but it may take away something from the finals of the
distance events.''
	   Earlier this week, Drummond said he wasn't going to worry about
the track. ``This is the Olympic Games,'' he said excitedly. ``Who
cares? If I cramp, I cramp. If my legs fall off, they fall off.
Because the bottom line is, I spent 10 years trying to get here,
and a little cramp is not going to stop me from accomplishing a
goal and a dream.''
