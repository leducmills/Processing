country in the eyes of the French media corps at the Olympic Games,
a refreshing and candid runner who just might steal a little of the
spotlight from male counterpart Michael Johnson. They both won
400-meter gold medals Monday night, and they're both striking out
this morning with the same objective in mind.
	   Since Johnson is a native of Texas, a graduate of Baylor and one
of the country's most visible track athletes, there is all sorts of
fanfare and publicity surrounding his bid for a historic 200/400
double. He'd be the first male to win both events in the Olympics.
Since Perec is a native of the French territory of Guadeloupe, a
member of the French Olympic team and a resident of Beverly Hills,
where she trains, she has slipped onto the stage without a proper
introduction.
	   The fact is, she would be the second woman to accomplish the
200/400 feat in the Games. Valerie Brisco-Hooks won both in Los
Angeles a dozen years ago, in the absence of the Eastern Europeans,
including Marita Koch of the former German Democratic Republic.
	   Perec was at a press conference put on by Reebok Tuesday morning
in the aftermath of her impressive performance in the women's 400
on the same night that Johnson and Carl Lewis fired the American
imagination. The press conference was conducted in French, with
only two US journalists in the audience. (Try this one on:
Question: ``Why do Americans like themselves so much?'' Answer:
``Why? Don't the French like themselves?'')
	   Perec grew up on Guadeloupe, part of the West Indies, raised by
her grandmother in an impoverished youth. John Smith has been her
coach and guru since she was dropped by French coach Jack Piasenta
in the spring of 1994 after bypassing the European Indoor
Championships in Paris. She learned to speak English and said Smith
has made her believe in herself.
	   Is the combination a touchy matter?
	   ``I lived there until I was 14,'' she said in English last week.
``It was a nice part of my life. I loved it there.''
	   She was asked about Smith's influence, how it changed her.
	   ``As my grandmother always says, `Everyone does it their own
way,''' said Perec in French through an interpreter. ``When I cross
the line (in a race), I always have a little thought for her.
Everyone was drinking punch back at home last night and (the gold
medal) gave them pleasure.''
	   She moved to France after a French coach timed her in a 200 race
in Guadeloupe and informed her she'd qualified for the French
national championships. She has set French records in the 100, 200,
400 and 400 intermediate hurdles. And on Monday night, before
82,773 in Olympic Stadium, she became the first woman to win two
gold medals in the 400.
	   She passed through the first 200 in 23.08 and didn't feel tired
en route to an Olympic record of 48.25. It bettered her previous
best of 48.83 and was history's sixth-fastest time and the best
since Koch's 48.22 at the 1986 European Championships. She also led
the fastest women's 400 finish in the books , six of them breaking
50 seconds , with Australian aborigine Cathy Freeman setting an
Oceania record (48.63) and bronze medalist Falilat Ogunkoya of
Nigeria an African record (49.10).
	   ``After the race,'' said Perec, ``I was so excited I couldn't
sleep all night. I was on a cloud. It was really great. It may have
looked easy, but Freeman was very, very strong and she's only 23. I
really had to go hard. I wanted to go out in 23 and come back in
25. I didn't quite manage that, but I more or less did what I
thought I would do. So there were no surprises as far as I'm
concerned. I'm approaching the summit of my performance, whatever
that may be.''
	   When she broke through to win the 400 in Barcelona, she said
Koch's record was out of reach in her competitive lifetime. Now
Smith, who also coaches sprinters Jon Drummond of the US and Ato
Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago, has made her think twice.
	   ``Living in America, I don't have any pressure and I've got a
great, relaxed coach,'' she said.
	   To paraphrase Horace Greeley: Allez ouest, jeune dame, allez
ouest.
	   ``I've never been so calm before a race,'' said Perec. ``I
wasn't afraid. I was confident. We left nothing to chance. I never
even thought about the race (Monday), and before I was always
stressed. I was so calm. It was if there wasn't a final on that
day. I ate. I rested. I listened to music and I just relaxed. I
more or less responded to what he told me to do.
	   ``I've teamed with John Smith and he has a way of approaching
things that's much more positive than I was used to. He puts my
goals very, very high and it's worked. He told me I was wrong not
to think about the world record. I used to laugh, but the more he
went on I realized he was serious. I think I'm exceptional. I know
that sounds pretty American, but he has an American way of
expressing himself. In France I didn't think I was exceptional.
That's what he's brought to me.''
	   She has run 22.30 for the 200 this season, placing her joint
fifth on the world list behind leader Carlette Guidry's 22.14 in
the US trials on the Olympic track. Perec's personal best is 21.99.
Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, a friend of Perec, owns the best time
(21.64) of those who will line up for the first heat Wednesday at
noon.
	   ``I'm not a 400 runner,'' said Perec. ``I'm a sprinter. I'm
going to go into the race very relaxed.''
	   Ottey, Guidry, Russia's Irina Privalova, Freeman and Jamaica's
Juliet Cuthbert are in the field, making the double a difficult
assignment.
	   ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' said Perec. ``I've
never done a double before. I'm just going to see what it's like.
Maybe I'll be right out of it after four days of 400s.
	   ``Michael Johnson knows what it's like going for the 400 and
training for the 200 in the same meet. I'm just going to try. It's
no risk. I've got to be prepared for a much faster rhythm. I may
have a chance, but (regardless of what happens) I've got the gold
medal I want.''
