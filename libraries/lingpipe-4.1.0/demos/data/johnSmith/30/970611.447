	   INDIANAPOLIS , For so basic a sport, track and field has
problems in this country.
	   The first U.S. national championships were held in 1876. The
1997 version began Wednesday and concludes Sunday. Once again,
those interested in the sport will read and hear of familiar
problems: World record-holders absent because of injuries and other
reasons.
	   Drug testing. Athletes like Mary Slaney, this nation's premier
female distance runner, and Sandra Farmer-Patrick, former American
record-holder in the 400-meter hurdles, have been besieged by
allegations of failed drug tests that have created a sideshow as to
whether they will compete.
	   Lack of interest. Less than a year after a glorious,
record-filled display at the Atlanta Olympic Games that drew
hundreds of millions of world-wide TV viewers, the sport is all but
out of sight as far as U.S. sports fans are concerned.
	   ``People walk up to me and say, `Good luck in 2000
(Olympics),''' says Dan O'Brien, gold medalist and world decathlon
record holder. ``They don't even realize we have a World
Championships this year. It's like track and field is a forgotten
sport in most of this country, except in an Olympic year.''
	   In a U.S. sports terrain where the public consciousness is
dominated by the NBA, NFL and Major League Baseball, track and
field remains a curiosity in some ways, the height of frustration
in others.
	   Many of its elite athletes , O'Brien, Carl Lewis, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee , decry the lack of leadership from USA Track and
Field, the national governing body.
	   They cite its lack of expertise in areas like generating
corporate funding, the lack of a professional circuit in this
country, meets that have gone under and the need to streamline the
national federation and the way meets are staged.
	   ``American sports fans want a three- or four-hour experience,''
says Mel Rosen, head coach of the men's 1992 Olympic team. ``They
are not going to sit through eight or nine hours at a track meet.''
	   ``Track and field is the cash cow of the Olympics, the most
popular sport world-wide,'' says UCLA assistant coach John Smith,
who trains world-class sprinters like Ato Boldon and Jon Drummond.
``Carl Lewis put a stamp on it by winning the long jump (his fourth
gold medal in the event). We have to seize the moment to promote
and market the sport in this country.''
	   Smith's assessment is shared by many, none more vehemently than
Lewis, the nine-time Olympic gold medalist.
	   ``It's basically dead in America in terms of being involved in
the fiber of this country's sports,'' Lewis says. ``People in this
country don't pay attention to it, other than every four years.''
	   Lewis places a measure of blame on college coaches and the
national federation.
	   ``The college coaches try to run this sport at the elite level
like a college sport, the way it was run before track was a real
professional sport,'' Lewis said.
	   ``Granted, athletes who are in college and 21 or younger should
listen to their coach, but you have to treat them different when
they are out of college.
	   ``An older athlete wants to be treated with respect and to know
the reason why you are told to do something a certain way. Erv Hunt
(the 1996 U.S. men's Olympic coach) never felt he had to explain
why he was doing something, it was, `This is the way it's going to
be done.'''
	   Lewis and others speak of the need for a ``David Stern type'' to
lead USATF, ``someone with vision to run a professional sport.''
	   ``Parents love track,'' said Lewis, whose parents started him
and his sister, three-time Olympian Carol, into the sport. ``You
don't get seriously hurt, you buy your kid a pair of shoes and some
shorts, and that's all they need.''
	   University of Texas coach Bubba Thornton agreed, saying crowds
at high school and college meets are consistently large.
	   ``At the Texas state high school meet, is the sport dying? Or on
Saturdays at the Texas Relays, is the sport dying?'' he said. ``The
sport is not in as bad a shape as some people want to make it.''
	   However, Thornton admited his sport is still behind other
sports.
	   ``We don't have the for-sure professionalism of the NBA, NFL or
PGA,'' he said. ``What would happen if our great athletes like Carl
and Jackie and Michael Johnson created a club system and they
developed and promoted meets in this country, instead of our
post-collegiate athletes having to go to Europe?''
	   Joe Douglas, manager of the Santa Monica Track Club and one of
the sport's most prominent agents, says the sport needs a total
overhaul.
	   ``We may have to let the sport die before we can bring it back
in this country,'' he said. ``The people running it now are
basically amateurs and college coaches who do not have NBA or NFL
experience that this sport needs now.
	   ``It is like driving down the street at 30 mph with someone
dying in your backseat, and you refuse to go 35 to get him to the
hospital in time,'' he said.
