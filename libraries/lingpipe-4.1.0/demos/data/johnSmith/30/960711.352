
	   Mike Powell stood on the runway for his sixth and final long
jump at the Olympic trials last month in Atlanta, and, like a
pilot, he went through his pre-flight checklist.
	   He was mired in sixth place, and only the top three jumpers
would return a month later to compete in the Summer Games.
	   ``You haven't trained this hard all year not to make the Olympic
team,'' the world-record holder told himself. ``You're supposed to
be on the team. You have a commercial coming out. You've got plans.
If you don't make the Olympic team, none of this really means
anything. They're not jumping that far. Third place is 27-1} and
you're not going to make the team? You need to slap yourself for
that. You know you can jump that far in your sleep.''
	   Adding a prayer for good measure, Powell launched himself
desperately, landing in both the pit and the Summer Games with a
leap of 27-6{. The jump was almost two feet short of his world
record of 29-4{, but far enough to win the trials.
	   His career has followed this twin path of drama and danger, with
Powell starting slowly, lapsing into trouble, then rescuing himself
with a stirring finish. He sort of builds to the big finale like a
Fourth of July fireworks display. He set his world record five
years ago in Tokyo on his fifth jump. And he made his third Olympic
team on his sixth.
	   ``Man, I was scared,'' said Powell, who lives in Rancho
Cucamonga, Calif. ``Although dramatic as it may be, and great for
television, at the time I was eating away at myself inside.
	   ``I hate doing that. It's too much stress. It's even more on my
friends and family. Everyone was mad at me. But I've always had
that confidence that, when my back's up against the wall, I can do
it. I've always been that underdog kind of athlete. If you're
playing me in basketball to 10, and it's 9-1, I still think I'm
going to win.''
	   He has won plenty, breaking Bob Beamon's 23-year-old world
record and taking two Olympic silver medals. But the gold has
eluded him. At age 32, this may be Powell's best chance to become
Olympic champion.
	   No one is dominating the long jump. Carl Lewis, the three-time
gold medalist, is 35 now. He has struggled in recent years,
qualifying for the Atlanta Games by one inch.
	   Ivan Pedroso, the world champion from Cuba, has undergone
surgery after a leg injury, and his status for the Games is
uncertain. Powell also has been bothered by injuries the past two
seasons. He is not in top form, but he may not have to be to win
the Olympics.
	   ``It's right there for me to win,'' Powell said of the gold
medal. ``It's really big. That's what athletes who compete in the
Olympics are judged by: Did you win the gold? Anyplace else in the
world, you've won the silver medal if you come in second. In the
United States, you didn't win the gold. To get a gold would help
finish off my career. I could close a chapter on track. I'll still
compete, but there won't be any pressure to prove anything.''
	   The pressure he admits, is still there. Even after setting the
world record. Powell still feels the need to prove something. If
not to his fans, the news media or other athletes, then to himself.
	   The 1992 Barcelona Summer Games were to be his moment of glory.
Powell had set the world record a year earlier. Shortly before the
Games, he jumped even farther, a wind-aided 29-6 at altitude in
Sestriere, Italy. Thirty feet seemed possible. At the Olympics,
Powell's jumping followed a familiar pattern. Lewis jumped 28-5{ on
his first jump, while Powell started unimpressively then began a
steady improvement. Again the competition distilled itself to
Powell's last jump. He leapt 28-4\, his best jump of the evening,
but it fell 1\ inches short of Lewis' jump.
	   His newfound celebrity, along with increased expectations became
``a little overwhelming'' in Barcelona, Powell said, adding that he
is better prepared to handle those external forces in Atlanta.
	   ``I really got an appreciation for what Carl goes through,''
Powell said. ``It's one thing to get to the top; it's so tough to
stay there, especially when you have someone like Carl Lewis behind
you.''
	   Because has an awkward jumping style, with a tendency to land on
one hip, Powell has been vulnerable to injury in recent years,
suffering everything from a strained hamstring to a broken bone in
his foot to maladies in his back, hips and knees.
	   Last year, he hit a low point. Pedroso broke his world record
(only to have it nullified because an Italian official interfered
with the wind gauge in Sestriere), and Powell managed only third
place at the world championships.
	   ``I was always used to winning or competing well,'' Powell said.
``Last year was the first year I was getting worse. The injuries
bothered me. I didn't train hard, which meant I wasn't going to
have the confidence to compete well.''
	   Two years ago, Powell switched coaches from Randy Huntington to
John Smith, who is renowned for his work with sprinters from 100 to
400 meters. While Powell became stronger and more fit, his
technique suffered. This season, Huntington has joined Smith as a
co-coach, and Powell has refined his his run-up to the takeoff
board.
	   ``I lost sight of how to set up the jump,'' Powell said. ``I was
trying to run like a sprinter. In order to long jump far, you have
to have a bouncy run and be under control, so you can take off.''
	   As entertaining as the suspense is, Powell would like to avoid
it at the Olympics. He is not looking for last-second heroics. He
would like to put the competition away early with, say, a jump of
28-6 on his first or second attempt. And let the others sweat it
out, not him.
	   If that doesn't work, he's prepared for the usual scenario.
	   ``The other guys know, when it comes down to it, I'm going to
pull something out,'' Powell said.
