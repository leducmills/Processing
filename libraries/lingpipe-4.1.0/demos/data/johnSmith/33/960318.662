
	   HOUSTON , Here is the latest word on Ross Perot: He is now
officially running for president, but this does not mean he is
really running for president. At least, not yet.
	   Organizers of the new political party that Perot is bankrolling
announced Monday that the Dallas billionaire has agreed to allow
his name to be entered as an independent presidential candidate on
petitions the party is circulating in Texas and in Florida to get
on the ballot for this November's election.
	   However, lest anybody conclude that Perot has therefore made up
his mind to run, party spokesmen say that he is only acting as a
stand-in for that magical nominee , ``George Washington the
Second,'' as Perot likes to put it , that he hopes his party will
settle on at a high-tech convention late this summer.
	   At that point, invoking a maneuver that would be unparalleled in
presidential politics, Perot says he plans to step aside and have
Mr. Washington 2nd substituted for the ``Ross Perot'' line the
party would have earned on the ballot.
	   Of course, Perot has never ruled out the possibility that he
just might have to bend to the will of the people in his new Reform
Party, whose operations he is financing in their entirety, if it is
the will of those people that Perot be the nominee.
	   Many people who follow Perot, who captured 20 million votes as
an independent candidate for president in 1992, took Monday's
announcement as simply the strongest sign yet that he plans to run
again.
	   ``All signs point to another Perot candidacy,'' said Larry
Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia who
has studied Perot.
	   ``He's spending millions of dollars of his own money to buy the
newest, shiniest fire engine,'' Sabato said. ``And when that engine
gets to the fire, can anyone imagine anyone else in the cab other
than Ross Perot?''
	   Well, yes, said Sharon Holman, a spokeswoman for the Reform
Party.
	   ``Perot will lend his name as the stand-in candidate, with the
understanding that he will step aside for the Reform Party
nominee,'' she said Monday in a telephone interview.

	   Perot may be just a phantom presidential candidate at this
point, but he even has a phantom vice-presidential nominee, at
least on the Florida petitions (he does not need to list a running
mate on the Texas form).
	   And that nominee is a man named Carl Owenby Jr.
	   While not exactly a household name, Owenby is ``just a wonderful
person, a small businessman in Florida, active with us over the
years, just a great American,'' said Russ Verney, the national
coordinator of the Reform Party.
	   Owenby did not return a telephone call to his base in north
Florida, where a woman answered Monday with the greeting: ``Perot
Reform Party.''
	   Verney said that Perot was allowing his name to be used as an
independent candidate only in those states where the Reform Party
was encountering difficulty in securing a separate spot on the
ballot. In many of those states, the number of signatures required
for an independent presidential candidate are significantly less
than those for a party ballot position.
	   By allowing his name to be entered as a presidential candidate
on the Florida and Texas petitions, Perot is of course encouraging
speculation that he is, well, a presidential candidate.
	   But Verney said he was doing so only because it would be
logistically difficult to list someone else's name: if the Reform
Party did so, Perot would be limited at that point in how much
money he could donate to the ``stand-in'' candidate. By being the
stand-in himself, he faces no such limits.
	   Having secured a spot on the ballot as an independent, it would
be unusual but not impossible for Perot to remove himself and
designate someone else instead, if that is what he really wishes to
do.
	   Richard Winger, the editor of the San Francisco-based Ballot
Access News, said that John Anderson, the independent presidential
candidate in 1980, had done something similar when he used the name
of Milton Eisenhower, the late president's brother, as his
vice-presidential running mate during the early months of his bid
to get on the ballot.
	   Later on, Anderson officially selected former Gov. Patrick Lucey
of Wisconsin to run with him, and in almost every state where
Eisenhower's name had appeared on the original petitions, Anderson
was able to have Lucey's name substituted on the November ballot.
	   ``In the couple of states where he was first denied, he sued and
won,'' Winger said.
	   Such a switch at the presidential level would be unprecedented
and could be subject to a new set of legal challenges , a threat
that the party might just invoke in deciding to settle on Perot as
its nominee after all.
	   Just to make things even more convoluted, Verney conceded Monday
that there could be a state or two where Perot is unable to get his
name off the ballot , but if he ``won'' those states in November,
he said Perot would immediately release his electors to cast their
votes for the true Reform Party nominee.
	   ``What he would be saying is, vote for John Smith, but in your
state you have to cast the ballot for me in order to vote for John
Smith,'' Verney explained.
	   Perot has repeatedly said that he is not keen on running again
and that his new effort is all about creating a new political
party, not a vehicle for another run at the White House. He has
said he has ``six or seven just incredible people in mind'' as
possible presidential nominees for his party, but he has yet to
name one.
