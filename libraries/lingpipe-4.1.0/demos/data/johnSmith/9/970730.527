	   You say you've been abducted by aliens. But can you provide a
certificate of authenticity?
	   I didn't think so, which is why you need to know more about
Alien Marketing and its new Home Alien Abduction Verification Kit
(H.A.A.).
	   The kit, which is ``Air Force approved,'' comes complete with
everything an abductee needs to prove an other-worldly abduction,
including an official poster and/or video of the alien encounter
and a certificate of authenticity.
	   There are also clips from three ``respected'' U.S. daily
newspapers detailing the abduction and a latex glove used in the
actual alien physical examination of the abductee.
	   As a bonus, H.A.A. also includes an audio tape capturing the
encounter:

	   Abductee: This is John Smith here with my captors. Say hello to
my friends.
	   Alien: He-ll-ooo.
	   Abductee: Well, guys, now do you believe me?

	   Judging by the number of people who claim to have been abducted
by aliens, the Home Alien Abduction Verification Kit should sell
very well. (I'd like to tell you how much this thing sells
(ITAL)for(END ITAL), but my calls to the people at Alien Marketing
went unreturned. Perhaps they were out power-lunching with the
little gray people. It's hard to say.)
	   It stands to reason that people who have been abducted by aliens
AND have a certificate of authenticity will get a lot more respect
than your basic, garden-variety abductee who has nothing to show
for the experience, except, perhaps, for a small metal plate
screwed into the base of his skull or an ability to short out the
Martian rover by running his tongue over his fillings.
	   Many bosses would not understand if you roll in at half past 10
and say, ``I'm sorry I'm late but I was abducted by aliens while
buying a Moon Pie and a Surge at the convenience store.''
	   But if you can back up your claim with a certificate of
authenticity, your boss will not only forgive you, but might even
offer himself up for some highly personal medical experimentation.
	   A certificate of authenticity would also come in handy if you
are pulled over by a cop.
	   ``You must understand, officer, that I did not run that stop
sign intentionally. What happened is that just before I got to the
intersection, I was beamed aboard the starship Elvis where I was
forced to watch a movie of the sort that would get you arrested in
Cincinnati, if you catch my drift, and then I felt this stainless
steel device worming its way up my pant leg and the next thing I
know I'm seeing red and blue lights flashing in my rear view
mirror. No, I haven't been drinking and I'm not taking any
medication. Why do you ask?''
	   Athletes like Mike Tyson, Albert Belle and Tonya Harding who
exhibit violent and/or unpredictable behavior can explain it all
away with a certificate of authenticity of alien abduction.
	   The ``men are from Mars, women are from Venus'' notion of
interpersonal relations would be much more believable if both
parties could produce certificates of authenticity of alien
abduction.
	   ``I'm sorry, honey, I wasn't listening. My mind was off
somewhere in outer space.'' That lame excuse carries a lot more
weight if you have an official document to back it up.
	   Of course, a dozen roses might not be a bad idea, either.
