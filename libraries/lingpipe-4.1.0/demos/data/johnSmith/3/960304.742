	   One way people in advertising enjoy spending their time , apart
from thinking lovely thoughts about clients, of course , is in
debating which television commercials might be the best ever made.
A new effort to identify the most creative spots is sure to stir
still more debate.
	   The Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, the giant agency that works for
marketers like General Motors, Hallmark, Kellogg and Philip Morris,
is coming out with its own list of ``the 100 best commercials of
all time.'' The list was developed by the creative exchange
department of Burnett, which was formed in 1984 to track and
collect outstanding advertising so that agency creative executives
might benefit from what has gone before.
	   ``Our original motivation was simply wanting a library of best
commercials as a resource for our creative people,'' said Donald
Gunn, senior vice president and director for creative resources
worldwide, who is based at the Burnett office in London.
	   ``If we were doing, say, testimonial commercials for the first
time in Argentina, the creatives there could watch a reel of the
best testimonials.''
	   The department creates about 700 such reels annually in
categories like type of commercial (testimonial, demonstration,
celebrity endorsement) and type of product (ice cream, fast food,
automobiles).
	   The 100 best list grew out of a request last year from Phil
Fiebig, managing director for the Burnett office in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, and vice president of the International Advertising
Association.
	   For a year-end meeting of the association, Gunn recalled, ``he
thought they should show a reel of the best-ever commercials and we
thought it would be a really nice reel to make.''
	   But oh, the work! The department sought suggestions from Burnett
offices around the world as well as from outside sources like O.
Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American
Association of Advertising Agencies in New York; John Webster, a
British agency creative executive, and Walter Lurzer, owner of
Lurzer's Archiv, a creative publication in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   ``Suddenly, our 100 commercials became 193,'' Gunn said. So in
August, seven members of the Burnett global product committee , top
executives who gather quarterly to critique new Burnett campaigns ,
spent an afternoon and evening voting to winnow the list to 100.
	   There is no ranking of best of the best; rather, the 100 spots
are grouped in categories like animals, blockbusters, children and
music. They include these offerings:
 The stirring ``1984'' spot for the Apple Macintosh personal
computer by Chiat/Day, now part of the Omnicom Group.
 The Volkswagen commercial by Doyle Dane Bernbach, now also
part of Omnicom, asserting that ``the man who drives the snowplow
drives to the snowplow'' in a Beetle.
 The warmly emotional spots for Coca-Cola featuring hilltop
singers and the football star Mean Joe Greene, both by the
McCann-Erickson New York unit of Interpublic Group of Companies.
 The humorous commercials for Alka-Seltzer focusing on bad
prison food (by Jack Tinker & Partners, once part of Interpublic)
and an actor who gets heartburn shooting a spot for Mama Magadini's
Spicy Meatballs (Doyle Dane).
 The commercials by Bartle Bogle Hegarty that concoct clever
ways to have young hunks doff their Levi's jeans without stooping
to salaciousness or sleaziness.
	   One surprise is that the list features a fair number of
surrealistic spots. One for Chanel No. 5, created in-house, is
centered on a mysterious swimming pool. Two for British Airways, by
what is now the Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide unit of
Cordiant PLC, show Manhattan Island coming in for a landing at
Heathrow Airport and thousands of people forming a human face.

	   Another surprise is the prevalence of simple ideas. For
instance, in a spot by Warwick & Legler, now part of Warwick Baker
& Fiore, a diver jumps off a cliff in Acapulco to prove that a
Timex watch ``takes a licking and keeps on ticking.''
	   A dog performs amazing tricks only after being promised a drop
of John Smith's Bitter in a commercial by Boase Massimi Pollitt,
now the BMP DDB Needham unit of Omnicom; ``he just needs the right
motivation,'' the owner explains.
	   A monk overwhelmed with an order for 500 illuminated manuscripts
finds a ``miracle'' in the form of a Xerox copier in a spot by
Needham, Harper & Steers, now part of DDB Needham. And to the
strains of ``The Stripper,'' a beautiful woman in a commercial by
William Esty (now part of Saatchi & Saatchi) urges a man to ``take
it off, take it all off'' with Noxzema shaving cream.
	   Various incarnations and units of DDB Needham landed the most
commercials on the list, 15, followed by Burnett itself, with
eight, including spots for Marlboro cigarettes (cowboys on a foggy
morning) and McDonald's (youngsters playing football).
	   BBDO Worldwide, also owned by Omnicom, followed with six
commercials. Saatchi & Saatchi and the Collett Dickenson Pearce
unit of Dentsu tied with five apiece, and Lowe Howard-Spink, part
of the Lowe Group owned by Interpublic, had four.
