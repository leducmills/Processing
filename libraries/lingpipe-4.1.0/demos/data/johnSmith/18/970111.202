could never know. Ditto for football fans watching in Texas,
Florida and California. And as for the NFL high rollers and Big
Event people who'll ride down Route 1 in limos Sunday, few of them
will understand.
	   Only native New Englanders , sports fans over the age of 40 ,
really know what the Patriots have been about all these years. The
frontrunners and young folks think it's always been fun and easy
like this.
	   No. Sunday's AFC Championship game will mean most to those
who've endured all the heartache and hysteria that's marked this
franchise for 37 years.
	   The 1997 Patriots have solid ownership, the best coach in the
business, five Pro Bowlers and a healthy shot at the Super Bowl.
But if you don't remember Clive Rush, you can't truly appreciate
how tough it's been to reach this point.
	   Rush coached the Patriots in 1969 and '70. He is best remembered
as the coach who was nearly electrocuted at his introductory press
conference. Poor Clive got up to speak, grabbed the microphone and
was toasted by faulty wiring.
	   Only the Patriots.
	   There are a million ``only the Patriots'' stories, and Sunday we
dust off a couple to remind us how far they have come.
	   There was the time Bob (Harpo) Gladieux, who had been cut from
the team, attended a game at Harvard Stadium only to hear himself
paged over the public address system. According to legend,
Gladieux' pal had gone to the concession stand to get some beers,
then returned to the seats only to see Harpo down on the field,
returning the opening kickoff.
	   The Patriots are the team that once found a kicker (John Smith)
through a radio show in England. They are the team that used to get
dressed at a Ramada Inn on Soldiers Field road. They are the team
that played a home game in Birmingham, Ala.
	   Only the Patriots could have an owner (Billy Sullivan) lose all
his money bankrolling Michael Jackson's Victory Tour. Sullivan was
succeeded by Victor Kiam, who sold very few Lady Remingtons after
his mishandling of the Lisa Olson episode.
	   They have been the Boston Patriots and the New England Patriots.
For a brief moment they were actually called the Bay State
Patriots, but somebody figured that they'd soon come to be known as
the ``BS Patriots.''
	   The Patriots were playing on ``Monday Night Football'' when
Howard Cosell told the world that John Lennon had been shot dead in
New York. The Patriots are the team that got trounced in the 1986
Super Bowl, then announced that more than a dozen players had
failed drug tests during the season.
	   Cheerleaders have been fired. There was the Stupor Bowl against
the Colts in 1981. There was Ken (Game Day) Sims, a wasted No. 1
pick. Doug Flutie. Upton Bell. Rod Rust. Weird Sam Jankovich.
Lawyers, guns and money.
	   The Patriots had Irving Fryar when Irving was the Oil Can Boyd
of football. Irving got stabbed by his wife before a playoff game.
Irving wrapped his car around a tree during the second half of a
football game in which he'd been a starting wide receiver.
	   Coach Chuck Fairbanks was pulled off the field by Sullivan in
Miami. Defensive back Ray Clayborn was punched out by sportswriter
Will McDonough. A convict on work-release illegally snowplowed a
patch of turf, allowing Smith to kick a game-winning field goal
against the Dolphins. General manager Patrick Sullivan got into a
fistfight with Oakland Raiders Howie Long and Matt Millen at the
end of a playoff victory.
	   Only the Patriots.
	   The Patriots play in a skeletal stadium that was built in
1970-71 for $7.1 million. In the visitor's locker room, at least
one urinal was installed 6 feet off the ground. Citing plumbing
problems, building inspectors threatened to close the place before
it ever opened, but Sullivan arranged to have all the stadium
toilets flushed simultaneously to prove that the system was OK.
	   Through the years, Foxborough fans have been New England's
answer to European soccer crowds. Fans have toppled out the back
end of the stadium. In 1980, fans were cuffed to chain-link fences
as police waited for more wagons to cart them off to jails. Five
years later, fans ripped down a goalpost, carried it out to Route 1
and were fried by high-tension lines, Clive Rush style. Because of
this rowdiness, the Patriots didn't play a Monday night game, after
that one in 1980, until last season.
	   And the Patriots have never played a championship game on New
England soil. Until Sunday.
	   The entire pro football world will be watching at 4 p.m. But
only a few of us will truly appreciate what we are seeing because
we remember where this team has been.
