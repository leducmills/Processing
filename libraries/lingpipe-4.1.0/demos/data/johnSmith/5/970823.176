	   There is a danger in having been a sports celebrity before
becoming a real-estate professional, agrees Gary Beban, who won the
Heisman Trophy as quarterback at the University of California at
Los Angeles in 1967. He is now president and second ranking
executive of CB Commercial Real Estate Group.
	   ``Certainly a Roger Staubach, and to a lesser extent a Gary
Beban, is more likely to get a meeting than John Smith,'' he said.
``But if you don't know your business, you will be worse off than
John Smith.''
	   Since most business executives are still men, the opening
chit-chat gathering will probably be about sports. ``You'll
probably talk about sports for the first five minutes,'' Beban
said. ``What happens in the next five minutes is a critical play.
If you don't really know your product, you risk having people label
you as just a dumb jock.''
	   He said that persuading people to look upon former sports heroes
as knowledgeable practitioners of another business is a challenge
greater than people with a normal business background face. ``It is
high hurdle, but if you can get over it you probably have an
advantage,'' Beban said. ``Certainly Roger has done that well.''
	   Well enough to develop a client list that includes IBM, GTE,
Mobil, Oryx Energy, the Travelers and TIG insurance companies and
Barnes & Noble.
	   Staubach opened his New York office in January after several
earlier efforts failed, including, according to industry sources,
preliminary merger talks with the then-private Edward S. Gordon Co.
(Gordon is now part of publicly traded Insignia Financial Group and
is being used as the base for a national expansion.)
	   ``I wish we could have been here 10 years ago,'' he said. ``But
we're not naive. You can't just take a guy from Dallas and put him
in New York. We'd get killed.'' If nothing else, he observed, the
legal documents associated with real estate transactions in New
York City are considerably thicker than those in other locations in
the country.
	   To manage the office, he chose three men who had been active as
tenant representatives in the city and its suburbs. Peter Hennessy
came from Cushman & Wakefield, Gregg Lorberbaum from the Freidman
Realty Group and Patrick Robinson from LaSalle Partners. Three
principals to manage one office is unusual in a business where most
field offices are headed by one person.
	   ``Roger thought this would be a very difficult market to
crack,'' said Hennessy. ``After all, it is the largest real estate
market in the world. So he wanted to assemble individuals with
differing areas of expertise.''
	   Although it is too soon to determine how successful the Staubach
venture in New York will be, industry veterans note that other
outsiders have succeeded in shouldering their way in. ``It's been
done,'' said O'Keefe, whose Grubb & Ellis firm got started in San
Francisco. ``CB Commercial is here and they started on the West
Coast,'' he said. ``LaSalle Partners is here, and they are based in
Chicago. So there are at least three good examples.''
	   Staubach, as might be expected, puts a high value on
organization and teamwork. ``You need teamwork to bring the right
services to the client,'' he said. And he says that as a tenant's
representative it is his job to lower clients' overall real estate
costs. His company will forgo its fee , typically 2 to 4 percent of
the gross lease , if the client is not satisfied with its
performance, he said. ``That has come around to bite us a few
times,'' he conceded.
	   But he said that losing a few fees was preferable to
contentious, litigious relations with his clients. ``We have never
had litigation with a client,'' he said. ``That's something that
may change in New York.''
