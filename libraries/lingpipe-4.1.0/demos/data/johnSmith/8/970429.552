
	   WASHINGTON, D.C. , Minimalism got you down? Too much flatness,
simplicity, restraint? Then head straight for the Library of
Congress.
	   The century-old Thomas Jefferson Building, foremost of the
library's three main buildings on Capitol Hill, reopens Thursday
after a massive, painstaking and dazzling restoration.
	   Its bright, polychrome interiors will immerse you in more
varieties of ornament than the modern mind can easily make sense
of: mosaics, murals, statuary, several varieties of classical
order, all wrapped up in a gigantic allegory designed to convince
visitors that only after several lifetimes here can they be saved
from ignorance.
	   Completed in 1897, the Jefferson Building is considered
Washington's first building to fully embody the beaux-arts style.
Jefferson himself would not have liked it. True, as ambassador to
France, Jefferson became an eager connoisseur of French
civilization. And before his tenure abroad, he had embraced the
classical tradition that the beaux-arts school later claimed to
uphold.
	   But beaux-arts classicism is a distant and ostentatious relation
of the restrained Palladian style Jefferson employed at Monticello.
The building's main facade, facing south, was partly modeled after
Charles Garnier's Paris Opera, the epitome of extravagant Napoleon
III style. Inside, the library surpasses its French model in the
lavishness of its decorations.
	   Actually they didn't get around to naming this edifice after
Jefferson until 1980. The name honors the man whose personal
library formed the core of the nation's official collection of
books. And the building's design, by John Smithmeyer, Paul Pelz and
Edward Pearce Casey, is a vast proclamation of late 19th-century
values.
	   Architects of the Gilded Age looked to Rome rather than Greece
as the historical precedent of American civilization. Rome was the
giver of laws, the maker of a global empire secured with awesome
power. Even a building like the Library of Congress, conceived to
honor the fruits of peace, spoke for an age when the United States
was moving into its own imperial phase. This was a staging ground
for the American Century.
	   So the library, naturally, has a dome. It is French in plan,
Italian in decoration and purely American in the exuberance with
which it sponges up the best of all earlier civilizations as a
young and muscular country's birthright. This is the grand
narrative the building has to tell: in murals, sculptures and
spaces that nearly overpower books even as the library raises them
to a place of national glory.
	   As at the Paris Opera, the visitor must run a gantlet of
grandeur before arriving at the building's principal space, in this
case the Main Reading Room, beneath the dome. One enters the
library through the Great Hall, an axial arrangement of receding
vistas and monumental staircases that ascend toward vertiginous
pinnacles of knowledge.
	   The restoration, by Arthur Cotton Moore & Associates, took 10
years and cost $81 million. It has rescued this priceless allegory
from years of indifference and neglect.
	   Partitions and dropped ceilings, added over the years to
accommodate the library's staff, have been excised. Colors , of
paint, stone and mosaics , that had turned black have been brought
back to vibrant life. The dominant tone throughout is a warm,
sunbeam yellow. We are in a place of radiance.
	   Patient visitors will wander down the concourses that lead from
the Great Hall's gallery, their barrel-vaulted ceilings studded
with gilded rosettes. Rooms at the end erupt in allegorical
extravaganzas. In the Pavilion of Arts and Sciences, the Arts are
represented by nude figures in postures of implied debauch. The
Sciences, arranged to greet the invention of the phonograph, are
tightly buttoned up. Elvis clearly had yet to make his first
record.
	   Turn right and you come to a hall full of cases displaying such
precious objects as the first page from Igor Stravinsky's score for
``Agon'' and Jefferson's handwritten recipe for pasta. These are
just two pieces of history in ``American Treasures of the Library
of Congress,'' a show meant to reflect the full range of the
Library's contents.
