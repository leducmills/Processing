	   Bruce Willis has those squinty eyes and that steely jaw.
	   Christopher Walken? Steely eyes, squinty jaw. Even the women in
``Last Man Standing'' are squinty and steely.
	   But all that squint and all that steel add up to two hours of
soft-focus, sepia-toned shut-eye in a gangster movie that fires
thousands of blanks.
	   ``Last Man Standing'' is a remake of the Japanese samurai
masterpiece, ``Yojimbo.'' Fortunately, ``Yojimbo'' remains
``Yojimbo.'' ``Last Man Standing'' serves only to remind us that
Demi Moore can no longer brag that she made the worst movie in the
Willis-Moore household this year. ``Last Man Standing'' makes
``Striptease'' look like ``That's Entertainment.''
	   Willis plays John Smith, a drifter who pulls into a dusty Texas
town in the 1920s, on his way to hide out in Mexico. But he stays
to shoot a couple of guys who tick him off.
	   When he learns that the town's only industry is a bootlegging
war between an Irish mob and an Italian mob, he decides to make
some money by shooting a few members of each.
	   Eventually, this makes both sides mad at him, but they can't
kill Smith because he never sleeps and sees out of the back of his
head.
	   Also, whenever he walks into a room with pistols drawn, he has
the magical power to make a dozen guys with tommy guns miss.
	   Eventually, Smith must face down Hickey (Walken), the only
killer as steely and squinty as he is. Hickey likes to talk a lot
before he guns people down, while Smith prefers to gun first and
crack wise later, so you can probably figure out who's going to win
that showdown.
	   Eventually, the movie ends. But not soon enough.
	   Writer/director Walter Hill has hit on hard times lately with
the box office failures of ``Geronimo'' and ``Wild Bill.'' But
those Westerns had good stories that just didn't click with
audiences. ``Last Man Standing'' is nothing but a series of
gunfights, as endless as they are pointless.
	   During one brief lull in the slaughter, a Texas Ranger stops by
to explain to Smith that one gang of killers is permissible, but
that two gangs is one too many and that if by the end of the week
there isn't just one gang left he's coming back to make sure that
there are no gangs.
	   If anyone has a clue as to what the Ranger was talking about,
please pass it on to Hill, who will be sure to use it when he makes
the sequel, ``Last Dead Man Dancing.''
	   ``Last Man Standing'' is rated R for violence, sex, nudity and
profanity. Fenster rating: 1 star out of 5.
