
	   John Smith (Bruce Willis), a samurai in a business suit, wanders
into a tough guy's dreamland when he hits the dusty little ghost
town called Jericho. The set belongs to a western, but Jericho has
been taken over by rival gangs of Depression-era bootleggers.
	   John describes this in fluent Dashiell Hammett or James M.
Cain-ese. ``Her name was Wanda,'' he says, having just been set up
by a prostitute and forced to leap out of bed and begin shooting.
	   ``Crossing me was nothing personal. She was just trying to make
a living in a world where big fish eat little fish.''
	   Which world exactly is that? Walter Hill has written and
directed ``Last Man Standing'' as a nominal reworking of Kurosawa's
``Yojimbo'' (which itself has a debt to American westerns). And
Hill seems to be dreaming in his own right. This superviolent,
sadly ineffectual homage to movie machismo is so solemnly brooding
that it turns morose whenever the guns stop blazing. While showing
off the film maker's grandiose and impressive ambitions, it has
none of the stirringly elegiac tone of ``Wild Bill,'' Hill's last
and much better exploration of a moribund Wild West.
	   Not being Toshiro Mifune, Willis also has a difficult task. He
plays the loner who, like Mifune in the 1962 Kurosawa film, is
called on to protect members of the rival gangs (``yojimbo'' means
bodyguard) and is initially content to function as a mercenary. But
then, in stunningly cliched fashion, he falls hard for a dame and
finds that his independence is compromised.
	   Not being much of a romantic, Hill supplies several dames, makes
each of them some kind of prostitute and has them duly slapped
around. In his view, this quite literally goes with the territory.
``Got girls to hire in this town?'' Smith asks. ``Hell yes, this is
West Texas,'' is the reply.
	   Willis does what he can to play this with steely conviction and
a knowing smirk. But the star is often left looking so impassive
that he barely moves his eyelids, in keeping with the film's
overall exaggerated restraint.
	   ``Last Man Standing'' comes to life only with rapturous
gunfights that add Sam Peckinpah to the film maker's pantheon of
heroes, and that are ear-splitting enough to jolt the audience out
of its seats. These scenes have their firepower, but they would
have larger impact if anyone cared which of the film's gangsters
lived or died.
	   Christopher Walken, Bruce Dern and Michael Imperioli are among
the players caught up in this gang war, with David Patrick Kelly
(so hilarious as a feisty Hell's Angel in ``Flirting With
Disaster'') as one of the film's more animated, less stylized mob
characters. Karina Lombard, Leslie Mann and Alexandra Powers
constitute the chattel. The film's wistful sepia compositions, as
photographed by Lloyd Ahern, who has worked three times before with
Hill on mournfully revisionist westerns, are often much more
interesting than the film's nihilistic drama.
