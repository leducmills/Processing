	   ``Last Man Standing'' begins with Bruce Willis' raspy
voice-over: ``It's a funny thing. No matter how low you sink,
there's still right and wrong.''
	   No, Willis isn't referring to such career nadirs as ``Hudson
Hawk.'' He's introducing us to the moral code of his character in
the film , a Man With No Name who calls himself John Smith.
	   The time is the Prohibition '30s and Smith, a loner gun-for-hire
en route to Mexico, stops in a small Texas border town called
Jericho. The place turns out to be Chicago South, i.e., two rival
gangs , one Irish, one Italian , are engaged in a long-running
battle over booze, turf and honor among killers.
	   Smith/Willis sizes up the situation and sees a way to play both
ends against the middle (``I'd seen the real thing and these guys
were a long way from it''). He hires himself out to whoever is
paying the most at the time and switches sides whenever it's
financially convenient.
	   But this soulless mercenary isn't quite as sold-out as he
thinks. By film's end, he realizes, ``When this thing started, all
I wanted to do was make some money. Somehow along the way, it got
personal.''
	   It gets really loud, blood-splattered and repetitious, too.
	   Based on Akira Kurosawa's 1961 samurai classic ``Yojimbo'' ,
only minus the wit and the flair , ``Last Man Standing'' combines
two Great American Movie Myths: the western and the gangster flick.
Thus, while Jericho's dusty streets echo Henry Fonda or John Wayne
in cowboy garb, they provide the setting for gang-war
gotterdammerung out of ``The Godfather'' or any given
early-Warner's Cagney picture.
	   Reworking ``Yojimbo'' isn't a bad idea for a movie, as Sergio
Leone proved with his wildly successful ``A Fistful of Dollars.''
And director Walter Hill is no slouch when it comes to stylish
overkill, as he proved with his 1979 pulp classic ``The Warriors.''
But this film, with its hard-boiled dialogue and bushels o'
bullets, is stylized to the point of self-parody.
	   Credit the supporting cast with diving right in , Bruce Dern as
a push-over sheriff; David Patrick Kelly and Ned Eisenberg as the
preening rival bosses; and Christopher Walken as Kelly's right-hand
gun, a guy so mean he slit his own father's throat when he was 10.
	   But it's up to Willis to carry the bulk of the action and, while
he's reasonably good, he's eventually overwhelmed by the movie's
incessant tough-guy posturing and histrionic violence. What's left
is a subpar ``Die Hard'' movie with a really snazzy wardrobe.
