	   London, July 1 (Bloomberg) -- Scottish & Newcastle, Britain's
largest brewer, said fiscal 1996 pretax profit before one-time
items rose 16.3 percent, as expected, as gains from last year's
acquisition of rival Courage more than offset a weak performance at
its leisure parks.
	   Pretax profit rose to 308.2 million pounds ($478.5 million) in
the year ended April 28 from 265.0 million pounds a year earlier.
Analysts had expected pretax profit of about 307.3 million pounds.
	   Edinburgh-based S&N also said it took a one-time charge of 150.8
million pounds for the reorganization of Courage, formerly the U.K.
brewing arm of Foster's Brewing Group Ltd.
	   ``It's very much in line with expectations,'' said Nigel Parson,
an analyst with Charterhouse Tilney Securities. ``The beer merger
looks like its going on track,'' he said.
	   Shares in the company were 1 penny lower at 658p in mid-morning
trading.
	   S&N's brewing unit, now called Scottish Courage, has ``held
market share and achieved a strong growth in earnings,'' Sir Alick
Rankin, chairman, said in a prepared statement.
	   While operating profit declined at the company's leisure
division, ``recent weeks have, however, seen a growth in bookings
due to our investment initiatives indicating a recovery later in
the year,'' he said.
	   Operating profit at Scottish Courage rose 48 percent to 121.4
million pounds.
	   ``The acquisition of Courage was earnings-enhancing,'' the
company said. Excluding Courage, operating profit rose 3.3 percent
to 84.7 million pounds.
	   S&N expects annual savings from restructuring the brewing
division to total 75 million pounds after fiscal 1998. In fiscal
1996, initial restructuring efforts produced 9 million pounds in
savings. S&N said in January it would close two of its nine
breweries, shut 13 of 41 outlets, and cut 1,600 jobs. ``Our
integration program is ahead of schedule,'' the company said.
	   Brewing profit was also boosted by higher sales volume and
consumer preference for premium brands. Take-home sales volume rose
4.7 percent, and international sales increased to almost 400,000
barrels.
	   S&N said operating profit at its leisure division fell 2.6
percent to 85.6 million pounds from 87.9 million pounds. The
company said slack consumer confidence and competition hurt its
Centre Parcs villages in the Benelux region, while opening costs at
its first German village were higher than anticipated.
	   ``Centre Parcs were a little bit worse than expected,'' said
Colin Davies, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. Operating profit at
Centre Parcs fell 2.1 percent, while operating profit at Pontin's
resorts fell 12.2 percent.
	   S&N said it's stepping up its investment in the Benelux parks
``to further distance us from these cheaper operators and move our
offer much more in line with the quality of service and facilities
now available in France and the U.K.''
	   Meantime, operating profit at the company's pub division,
including the Rat & Parrot, Chef & Brewer and Homespreads chains,
rose 10.3 percent to 157.4 million pounds. At the company's managed
pubs, operating profit rose by 16 percent.
	   ``The pubs division is very good, and there's plenty of
potential there,'' said Parson of Charterhouse Tilney. S&N said
spending on its pub projects was at an all-time high.
	   In addition, S&N's pubs got a boost from the Courage
acquisition, which added lagers like Foster's Holsten and Miller
Pilsner to S&N's portfolio of darker brews, like Newcastle Brown
Ale and Theakston Best Bitter.
	   ``The full benefits of the integrated portfolio, including such
successful new brands as Foster's Ice and John Smith's Extra
Smooth, will be seen in 1996/97,'' the company said.
	   Sales rose 46.9 percent to 2.97 billion pounds, from 2.02
billion pounds a year ago. Earnings per share rose 7.7 percent to
39p from 36.2p.
	   The company said it will pay a second-half dividend of 12.88p a
share. That boosts the year's total dividend to 19.43p, up 8.2
percent from 17.96p a year ago.
