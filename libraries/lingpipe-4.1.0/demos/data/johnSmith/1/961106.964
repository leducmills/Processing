
	   The observation by George Bernard Shaw that England and America
are two countries separated by the same language is no longer true,
at least when it comes to advertising.
	   A new retrospective of Britain's best television ads from the
last 20 years, brought to New York by the Museum of Modern Art and
now traveling to other museums, traces the changes in British
television advertising, which has evolved from small, charming
vignettes full of tongue-in-cheek humor to sleekly photographed
campaigns, many with references to the United States and its
culture.
	   Compiled from the top award-winning TV ads chosen annually by
the judges of the British Television Advertising Awards, the
program also looks at changes in the British creative process.
	   Directors like Ridley Scott, Alan Parker, Hugh Hudson and Adrian
Lyne cut their teeth in advertising in London in the 1970s before
moving on to advertising and filmmaking on the other side of the
Atlantic.
	   Scott, for instance, created the former Chiat/Day's ``1984'' TV
ad for Apple Computer, and also directed the Hollywood movies
``Alien,'' ``Blade Runner'' and ``Thelma and Louise,'' among
others. The agency, now called TBWA Chiat/Day, is a unit of the
Omnicom Group.
	   In these directors' work, exemplified by Parker's 1976 Collett
Dickinson Pearce & Partners ad for Parker Pens, in which the
actress Penelope Keith teaches a class of finishing-school girls
how to use a pen, ``every frame of film counted,'' said Barry Day,
director of creative communications for the Interpublic Group of
Cos. and a founding judge of the TV awards program.
	   ``There was a much more visual approach than in the United
States,'' he added.
	   Day also said he believed that these directors and their
successors felt more compelled than their counterparts in the
United States to entertain their audience. ``The United States is a
selling culture; it's prestigious to be a good salesman,'' he said.
``But in the United Kingdom, selling is vulgar. People don't mind
buying, but they don't want to be sold.''
	   Not surprisingly, this sentiment has led to a soft sell in many
ads, achieved through quintessentially British humor. According to
Day, ``in the UK, ads are designed to make you smile, charm you,
create rapport, and then sell.''
	   One example is a highly praised 1987 ad for Hamlet cigars, also
by Collett Dickinson Pearce, in which a homely man, frustrated in
his attempt to take his own picture in a self-service photo booth,
calms down by lighting up a Hamlet; Day said this spot had
succeeded because of ``the simplicity, the excellence of the joke
and the performance; we've all been there.''
	   According to Peter Bigg, the administrator of the TV awards, the
1980s marked the first time that advertisers in the United States
and Britain began to pay serious attention to each other's work.
	   Since then, British advertisers clearly have taken some of their
cues from the United States.
	   The Monty Python alumnus John Cleese appears in a 1992 black and
white Saatchi & Saatchi ad for Schweppes tonic water that is a sly
takeoff on Calvin Klein's campaign for Obsession perfume: Cleese
and a woman trade nonsensical barbs that parody the Obsession ads'
posturing. Saatchi & Saatchi is now owned by Cordiant PLC.
	   Several ads for Levi's 501 jeans by Bartle Bogle Hegarty borrow
heavily from American culture: A 1993 spot, depicting a handsome
young man traveling from back yard to back yard, via swimming pool,
refers to the 1968 film ``The Swimmer,'' itself adapted from a
short story by John Cheever, while a black and white 1994 spot shot
at Yosemite National Park recalls the old West, as well as
photographs by Ansel Adams.
	   Laurence Kardish, curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art,
finds British TV ads today less witty than in the past, perhaps
because of the onslaught of global marketing of products like
Levi's. ``A striking visual counts more than repartee,'' he
suggested.
	   Like Kardish, Bigg finds that many recent ads have ``got a hard
edge , they've lost their charm.''
	   Comparing a 1985 Boase Massimi Pollitt ad for John Smith's beer,
in which two Laurel and Hardy look-alikes do a funny routine, with
a 1995 campaign by GGT Group for Holsten Pils, featuring a
fast-talking, sardonic, unshaven beer drinker, he lamented the loss
of ``song and dance'' in beer advertising, one of the largest
British categories.
	   In addition, he believes that much current advertising, both in
the United States and in Britain, emphasizes expensive, technically
sophisticated production above all other values, a trend begun with
Richard Loncraine's well-known 1983 ``Manhattan Landing'' spot by
Saatchi & Saatchi for British Airways, in which a flying island of
Manhattan lands at night at an airport, much to the surprise of the
onlookers.
	   The trend continued in Tony Kaye's 1995 ``Twister'' ad by
Omnicom's Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO for Volvo, in which a
meteorologist driving a Volvo attempts to study the eye of a
tornado.
	   Bigg attributes the new, hard edge in some British campaigns in
part to the lack of stability since the early 1990s in the British
economy in general and in the advertising industry there in
particular.
	   Day calls these tougher ads ``nouvelle ugly, to go along with
the trend toward fashionable grunge created by MTV.''
	   ``To pin your faith on a style or look that will probably change
tomorrow is quite a gamble,'' he warned, because it goes against
the main tenet of advertising, which is to build a brand over time
around consistent elements.
