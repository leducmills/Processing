	   LOS ANGELES , CNN arrived at Rancho Park Golf Course in West Los
Angeles on Monday to catch a glimpse of the future.
	   With Mars already conquered, the cable channel shifted its focus
to the PK2 robot caddy, which has been carrying golf clubs at
Rancho since January. What it found was disappointed golfers.
	   ``It feels too gimmicky to me,'' Peter Frye said. ``I'd rather
carry my clubs or use a cart. I don't see the point of it.''
	   Jimmy Chiang, a Sandpiper pro, said he used the PK2 for one
hole.
	   ``It had a mind of its own,'' Chiang said. ``I parked it and it
kept turning by itself. So I had a marshall drive it in.''
	   Actually, robot caddies likely are here to stay, since most
courses don't employ human caddies anymore.
	   The PK2 is a three-wheeled unit with four remote-controlled
steering directions: forward, left, right and stop. The golfer can
control it or have someone else handle it. Either way, the cost to
rent is $7 for one bag or $12 for two bags.
	   Besides the PK2, made by the Oxnard, Calif.-based Golf Group of
America, a Santa Clara, Calif., company is testing the InteleCady,
which not only holds golf bags but tells how many yards the ball is
from the green.
	   The InteleCady is reportedly being tested at the San Jose
Country Club, with an eye toward full operational status before the
end of the year. Distribution throughout the Sun Belt could happen
by next June.
	   PK2 can't spout yardage yet, Golf Group president Steve Boyer
said, but the company expects to offer that feature when the PK3
model is introduced next year.
	   Officials at Golf Group of America and GolfPro International,
which is testing InteleCady, said the point of these robots is to
allow the golfer to walk the course without having to carry or pull
his clubs.
	   ``People want to exercise,'' said Bob Allen, Golf Group's
founder and executive vice president. ``Walking on the golf course
is the purest way to play.''
	   ``In the last 30 years, human caddies sort of disappeared from
the face of the earth,'' GolfPro CEO Ron Davies said. ``They're
only available at elite clubs, and being an avid golfer , as are my
business partners , we realized preserving the right to walk was
important to the long-term and continued success of the business of
golf and the game of golf.''
	   Regardless, golfers around the area seem lukewarm to the idea a
human caddy can be replaced.
	   Los Robles Golf and Country Club used an earlier model of the
PK2 but discontinued it because, pro David Sink said, the
technology needed improving and there was no room to store them.
	   The local fire department also was concerned about the potential
for trouble with cables used for charging robot batteries.
	   John Smith, a pro at Desert Aire Golf Club , said he has no use
for robots.
	   ``I'm from the old school,'' Smith said. ``It slows down the
game.''
	   Golf Group marketing director Morty Mittenthal said he has a
contract with Sandpiper Golf Course in Goletato introduce them
later this year.
	   Golf Group president Steve Boyer said he's aware of the
naysayers, which also include the cart concessionaires, who fear
losing money, he said.
	   He agreed it could take a golfer two or three times to become
comfortable with the robot. In the meantime, he said, the
technology can only improve.
	   It was just fine for Todd Lubin and MikeFitzpatrick on Monday.
	   ``It was great walking,'' Lubin said after completing a round
with a teen operating the robot.
	   ``It was nice not having to carry our bags,'' Fitzpatrick said.
