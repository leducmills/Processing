
	   NEW YORK , Msgr. Robert Brucato, the chancellor of the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of New York, was named by Pope John Paul II
Tuesday to be a new auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese, an
appointment that observers said suggests that Cardinal John
O'Connor will not retire in the next year or two.
	   The Vatican also said that it had accepted the resignation of
the bishop of Trenton, N.J.
	   Priests in the New York archdiocese and Catholic experts outside
it said that if O'Connor, 77, were expected to leave his post as
archbishop of New York imminently, the appointment of a new
auxiliary bishop by the Vatican would have been delayed until the
cardinal's successor could have a say.
	   O'Connor is two years past the retirement age of 75 for
cardinals and bishops, but does not have to retire until the
Vatican instructs him to do so. There has been considerable
speculation in church circles about when that might happen.
	   Brucato, whose appointment will become formal after an Aug. 25
ceremony during which he will be ordained a bishop, will become the
fifth active auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese and, at 66, the
youngest; the four others are all over 70. Several observers said
he would bring a dash of relative vigor to a group that needs it.
	   ``We're an antiquated church , or, rather, we have an antiquated
leadership,'' Msgr. Thomas Leonard, pastor of Holy Trinity Roman
Catholic Church in Manhattan, said with a chuckle. ``We have nobody
with young legs. And as the Babe said, the legs go first.''
	   As an auxiliary bishop, which means an assistant bishop who is
not the head of his own diocese, Brucato will take on new duties
that are largely ceremonial, such as representing the cardinal at
events and presiding over confirmations. Brucato said that at least
for the coming months, he will not leave his post as chancellor.
	   He said that he was both honored and humbled to become a bishop.
``It's an overwhelming thought to be following in the footsteps of
the apostles,'' Brucato said after his appointment Tuesday.
	   Brucato was born in the Eastchester section of the Bronx to
Italian immigrants and has spent most of his career in the
Archdiocese of New York, serving as a priest in more than half a
dozen parishes in the suburbs of West Harrison and Ossining and the
boroughs of Staten Island and the Bronx. Between 1960 and 1982, he
worked as a military chaplain, with various postings around the
world.
	   Also Tuesday, the Vatican announced its acceptance of the
resignation of Bishop John Reiss, 75, of the Diocese of Trenton.
Bishop John Smith, who had been flagged as Reiss' successor in
November 1995 and has been working beside him since then, has
officially taken over the bishop's role and duties.
	   Smith, 62, previously worked as an auxiliary bishop in the
Archdiocese of Newark and as the bishop of the Diocese of
Pensacola-Tallahassee, Fla.
