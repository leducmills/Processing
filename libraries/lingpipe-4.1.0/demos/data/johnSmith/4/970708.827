
	   NEWARK, N.J. , Monsignor Vincent Breen, the Vicar of Education
for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, N.Y., was named by the
Vatican on Tuesday to be bishop of the Diocese of Metuchen, in
central New Jersey.
	   Breen, 60, will be the third bishop to lead the Diocese of
Metuchen, which covers Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset and Warren
Counties. He is replacing Bishop Edward Hughes, 76, who has served
since 1987 and is retiring.
	   Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the Archdiocese of Newark was
the first bishop to lead the Metuchen Diocese, which was created in
1981.
	   Breen has spent 21 years overseeing education in the Diocese of
Brooklyn, which has 73,800 students in 180 schools. As Vicar of
Education, he was a top adviser to Cardinal John O'Connor on public
policy issues involving Catholic education in New York City, said
Frank DeRosa, a spokesman for the diocese.
	   Breen was a vocal critic of a 1985 ruling by the U.S. Supreme
Court that barred public school teachers from going into religious
schools to provide Federally mandated remedial education. The court
overturned that ruling last month.
	   Although Metuchen is a relatively small diocese, its school
system is growing faster than those in New Jersey's four other
dioceses. It has six Catholic high schools with 3,749 students and
40 elementary schools with 14,267 students. Enrollment is growing
by 5 percent a year, according to school officials in the diocese.
	   In comparison, the Archdiocese of Newark has 39 high schools and
150 elementary schools, with a total of 56,861 students. Its
enrollment, though, has declined since 1990.
	   Metuchen is the second of New Jersey's five dioceses to receive
a new bishop this summer. Last week, the Vatican accepted the
resignation of Bishop John Reiss, 75, of the Diocese of Trenton.
Bishop John Smith, 62, who was chosen as his successor in 1995, has
already taken over the bishop's duties.
	   In a separate announcement Tuesday, Pope John Paul II named
Monsignor Paul Bootkoski to be an Auxiliary Bishop in the
Archdiocese of Newark. Bootkoski, pastor of St. Gabriel's Church in
Saddle River, N.J., will be the fifth active auxiliary bishop in
the archdiocese.
