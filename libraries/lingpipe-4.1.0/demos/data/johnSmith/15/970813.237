	   London, Aug. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Royal Bank of Scotland Plc said
it will buy Birmingham Midshires Building Society for as much as
630 million pounds ($995 million) to double its mortgage assets and
extend its branch network into England.
	   Royal Bank, Britain's ninth-largest, has been increasing its
retail business in telephone and supermarket banking, credit cards
and selling mutual funds. It has been looking for a reasonably
priced building society to buy for about two years.
	   Birmingham Midshires is the latest building society -- a
mortgage company owned by its customers -- to convert to or be
bought by a bank, as they seek more flexibility in raising capital
and entering new businesses. Five building societies are leaving
the sector this year.
	   ``The problem with Royal Bank of Scotland has always been that
it's behind the Big Four (in terms of assets and deposits) and
while this will not be a cure-all it should help,'' said Robin
Evans, manager of Save & Prospers Financial Securities Fund, with
239 million pounds under management. He viewed the acquisition as
``mildly positive.''
	   Royal Bank also said it raised 200 million pounds by issuing
33.4 million new shares and placing them with Scottish Widows Funds
and Life Assurance Society, which will now hold 4.7 percent of the
bank's stock.
	   Royal Bank's shares were down as much as 20 pence or 3.2 percent
to 605.5 pence, and were recently at 609 pence. The bank's shares
have increased 8.3 percent this year, making it the second-worst
performer among the U.K. banks, beating only Abbey National Plc's
7.9 percent increase.
	   Birmingham's 1.2 million customers should each get windfall
payments of about 500 pounds in shares, though precise details have
yet to be completed.
	   The acquisitions of Birmingham Midshires will make the Royal
Bank the nation's 10th-largest mortgage lender, with residential
mortgage assets of 12 billion pounds. It will also raise its branch
network by 115 to 775, and give the bank its first presence in the
English Midlands. ``This announcement is the latest in a series
from us in recent months, but what all of them have in common is
extending the reach of our retail banking operation,'' said Royal
Bank Chief Executive George Mathewson at a press conference.
	   He said it would increase deposits by 75 percent and retail
customers by 40 percent, increase efficiency and increase
opportunities for selling mutual funds and credit cards to
Birmingham Midshire customers.
	   Investors, he added, ``should in no way think that this is the
end of the Royal Bank of Scotland's ambitions ... in the retail
sector. We would be interested if the right deal came along,'' he
said. That could include another building society, Royal Bank
officials said.
	   John Smith, a U.K. equities strategist at Henry Cooke Lumsden,
said the acquisition makes Royal Bank the most likely bank share to
make gains in coming days, even though it is too small a deal to
generate fresh interest in the bank shares.
	   ``We've been expecting corporate activity in this sector all
year and it's difficult to see how the bank industry can support
more of a re-rating,'' he said. ``There is so much already in the
price.''
	   Royal Bank of Scotland is currently trading at 11 times earnings
compared with the FT-SE Banks index, which is trading at about 20
times earnings. ``Royal Bank of Scotland has lagged significantly
recently, and may have some room to run,'' said Smith.
	   The price for Birmingham Midshires -- somewhere between 605
million pounds and 630 million pounds -- will be determined with a
formula, agreed to by both companies, that will calculate a
price/earnings ratio of 12 on Birmingham Midshires' profit achieved
over the 12 months ending June 30, 1998. Mathewson said the price
to book value ratio would be about 1.7 times.
	   ``I think it's a reasonable price,'' Mathewson said. If the
resultant price is lower than 605 million pounds, the purchase can
be canceled by either party, they said.
	   The companies said they expect the transaction, which is subject
to the completion of due diligence, member and regulatory
approvals, and ``certain other conditions,'' to be complete by the
second half of 1998. Mathewson said he foresaw no regulatory
problems.
	   J.P. Morgan advised Birmingham Midshires on the transaction
while Robert Fleming & Co. advised the Royal Bank.
	   The Royal Bank chief also predicted that Birmingham's 1.2
million members will approve the purchase, ``because basically it's
the right price for the business,'' he said. The majority of
Birmingham members are likely to receive free preferred shares as
payment as opposed to a cash windfall, Mathewson said.
	   With increased volume, Mathewson said Royal Bank can reduce the
cost/income ratio of the building society, which stands at around
52.8 and is down from around 57 a year earlier, ``to competitive
levels,'' which he did not quantify.
	   It also has immediate plans to save about 8 million pounds with
the closing of Birmingham's mortgage processing center in
Bracknell, west of London -- a move the building society had
considered already, the companies said. The Bracknell operations
will be transferred to Birmingham's head office in Wolverhampton in
the west Midlands.
	   ``Apart from the closing of Bracknell, we do not envisage the
closure of branches,'' Mathewson said. He said there would be some
job losses at the processing center but they will be achieved by
people retiring or resigning on their own.
	   For at least three years after completion, Birmingham Midshires
will continue to operate as a separate business, with its own
board, management structure, branch network, product range, and
brand, the companies said.
	   Mike Jackson, chief executive at Birmingham Midshires, told a
news conference the acquisition by Royal Bank will allow Birmingham
Midshires to expand its product range to credit cards, mutual funds
and other products to enhance the service it now offers its
customers.
	   Royal Bank has been increasing its retail banking business in
various ways recently, and Mathewson said they will diversify the
business rather than compete with each other's business.
	   Its Direct Line subsidiary, which offers auto insurance over the
phone, has been taking deposits and selling mortgages, and it has
begun a supermarket bank subsidiary in association with Tesco Plc.
Royal Bank has been offering low interest rates on credit cards and
selling Scottish Widows mutual funds through its branches and
Direct Line.
	   ``We've got different businesses using very different delivery
systems, and I think the jury is out on which will be successful,''
said Mathewson.
	   Halifax Plc, Woolwich Plc and Alliance & Leicester Plc have
converted to banks from building societies this year, and Bristol &
West Plc has been acquired by Bank of Ireland. Northern Rock
Building Society will convert to a bank in October.
