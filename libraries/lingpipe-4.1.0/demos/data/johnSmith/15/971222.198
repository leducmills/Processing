	   London, Dec. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.K. stocks were mixed as signs
of slower economic growth depressed retailers, while boosting other
stocks which benefit from prospects that interest rates won't soon
rise.
	   ``We're not seeing the Christmas boom (in retail sales) people
were expecting,'' said Nat Jolowicz, a fund manager at Quilter &
Co. Ltd., which manages assets worth 3 billion pounds ($5 billion).
That and slower economic growth, ``take a little bit of pressure
off interest rates.''
	   The U.K.'s benchmark FT-SE 100 Index declined 15.2 points, or
0.30 percent, to 5005.0. Among retailers, depressed by evidence of
slow Christmas sales, Boots Co. Plc dropped 15p to 866, Great
Universal Stores Plc fell 13p to 723 and Kingfisher Plc declined
143.5p to 828.5. The broader FT-SE 250 fell 0.06 percent to 4702.3.
	   Retailers have been left with 3 billion pounds of unsold stock
after slow seasonal sales, according to a report by the Centre for
Economics and Business Research, cited in the Independent.
	   In further evidence of slowing growth, the government cut its
estimate of third-quarter growth to 0.8 percent from an earlier
estimate of 0.9 percent growth.
	   Still, ``what's bad news for some is good news for others,''
Jolowicz said. Poor retail sales mean the Bank of England may not
raise interest rates early next year, easing the debt burden on
many companies and boosting profit.
	   Land Securities Plc and British Land Co. both gained as falling
bond yields make property investments more attractive. Institutions
often buy buildings as long term investments if the yield on
property is higher than long-term bond yields.
	   Land Securities rose 12p to 968.5, while British Land gained
11.5p to 664.5. The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds
fell to 6.25 percent today from 6.32 percent on Wednesday last
week.
	   Jolowicz has bought utilities over the last week on the prospect
long-term interest rates won't go any higher, increasing the appeal
of utilities which tend to offer steady dividend yields.
	   All the same, some power generators fell after the Financial
Times reported that competition in the U.K. electricity supply
market could be delayed beyond April. National Power Plc fell 9.5p
to 575.5 and Scottish Power Plc fell 8.5p to 517.5.
	   U.K. interest rates are likely to rise once more next year,
probably no more than 25 basis points, said John Smith, an equity
strategist at Henry Cooke Lumsden.
	   Gains in U.K. stocks this morning were checked by a slump in
Asian markets overnight. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 2.24
percent, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped 3.37 percent.
	   Later in the day, U.S. stocks pared their early gains,
triggering a decline in the British market. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 0.55 percent to 7798.39, after earlier
rising as high as 7844.72.
	   Rolls-Royce Plc advanced 7p to 228 after the Financial Times
reported it may be in settlement talks with a Panamanian company
which claims the engine maker failed to pay promised commissions.
Aerospace Engineering Design Corp. dropped the court action in the
case which involves a 20 billion-pound sale to the Saudi Arabian
Air Force.
	   Legal & General Group Plc leaped 29.5p to 509.5 after Credit
Lyonnais Laing recommended investors switch out of rival Prudential
Corp. and into Legal & General. Shares in Prudential fell 14p to
719.
	   BTR Plc fell 2.25p to 182.25 after the Mail on Sunday said the
industrial, transportation and construction company is close to an
agreement to sell its bottle-making business to the U.S.-based
packaging maker Owens-Illinois Inc. for 700 million pounds ($1.1
billion). BTR has said it will sell one-third of its businesses to
concentrate on engineering.
	   British Aerospace Plc gained 5p to 1686 after it was recommended
in the Sunday Times. The aerospace company will finish a great year
with an announcement today on the Eurofighter agreement, the paper
said.
