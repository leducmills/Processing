	   London, Dec. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.K. stocks were mixed as signs
of slowdown in consumer spending depressed retailers, while
boosting other stocks which benefit from prospects that interest
rates won't soon rise.
	   ``We're not seeing the Christmas boom (in retail sales) people
were expecting,'' said Nat Jolowicz, a fund manager at Quilter &
Co. Ltd., which manages assets worth 3 billion pounds ($5 billion).
That and slower economic growth, ``take a little bit of pressure
off interest rates.''
	   The U.K.'s benchmark FT-SE 100 Index declined 2 points, or 0.04
percent, to 5018.2. Among retailers, Boots Co. Plc dropped 15p to
866, Great Universal Stores Plc fell 14p to 722 and Kingfisher Plc
declined 18p to 825. The broader FT-SE 250 fell 0.07 percent to
4701.8.
	   Retailers have been left with 3 billion pounds of unsold stock
after slow seasonal sales, according to a report by the Centre for
Economics and Business Research, cited in the Independent.
	   ``It's a late Christmas, that's for sure, but it may yet live up
to expectations,'' said Nick Knight, a strategist at Nomura
Research Institute Europe Ltd.
	   In further evidence of slowing growth, the government cut its
estimate of third-quarter growth to 0.8 percent from an earlier
estimate of 0.9 percent growth. ``There are earnings implications
from weak growth,'' coupled with this year's appreciation in the
pound, Knight said.
	   Still, ``what's bad news for some is good news for others,''
Jolowicz said. Poor retail sales mean the Bank of England may not
raise interest rates early next year, easing the debt burden on
many companies and boosting profit.
	   Land Securities Plc and British Land Co. both gained as falling
bond yields make property investments more attractive. Institutions
often buy buildings as long term investments if the yield on
property is higher than long-term bond yields.
	   Land Securities rose 10.5p to 967, while British Land gained 6p
to 659. The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds was
recently 6.26 percent, down from 6.32 percent on Wednesday last
week.
	   Jolowicz has bought utilities over the last week on the prospect
long-term interest rates won't go any higher, increasing the appeal
of utilities which tend to offer steady dividend yields.
	   All the same, some power generators fell after the Financial
Times reported that competition in the U.K. electricity supply
market could be delayed beyond April. National Power Plc fell 11.5p
to 573.5 and Scottish Power Plc fell 11p to 515.
	   U.K. interest rates are likely to rise once more next year,
probably no more than 25 basis points, said John Smith, an equity
strategist at Henry Cooke Lumsden.
	   Gains in U.K. stocks this morning were checked by a slump in
Asian markets overnight. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 2.24
percent, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped 3.37 percent.
	   Later in the day, U.S. stocks pared their early gains,
triggering a decline in the British market. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 0.57 percent to 7800.38, after earlier
rising as high as 7844.72.
	   Rolls-Royce Plc advanced 5.75p to 226.75 after the Financial
Times reported it may be in settlement talks with a Panamanian
company which claims the engine maker failed to pay promised
commissions. Aerospace Engineering Design Corp. dropped the court
action in the case which involves a 20 billion-pound sale to the
Saudi Arabian Air Force.
	   Legal & General Group Plc leaped 35p to 515 after Credit
Lyonnais Laing recommended investors switch out of rival Prudential
Corp. and into Legal & General. Shares in Prudential fell 13p to
720.
	   BTR Plc fell 3p to 181.5 after the Mail on Sunday said the
industrial, transportation and construction company is close to an
agreement to sell its bottle-making business to the U.S.-based
packaging maker Owens-Illinois Inc. for 700 million pounds ($1.1
billion). BTR has said it will sell one-third of its businesses to
concentrate on engineering.
	   British Aerospace Plc gained 4p to 1685 after it was recommended
in the Sunday Times. The aerospace company will finish a banner
year with an announcement today on the Eurofighter agreement, the
paper said.
	   Blue Circle Industries Plc rose 21.25p to 315. The cement and
building materials producer was raised to ``trading buy'' from
``underperform'' by analyst Neil Shah at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
	   TI Group Plc jumped 12p to 451.5 after the engineering company
said it has bought a mechanical seals business from U.S.-based EG&G
Inc. for $100 million. At the same time, it's selling its Befab
steels business to EG&G for $45 million. TI said it would pay EG&G
the balance in cash.
	   French Plc fell 15p to 37.5. The textile and home furnishings
maker said full year 1997 profit will be below expectations after a
review of the company's Asia Pacific unit revealed ``substantial''
unauthorized expenditure.
