	   London, Dec. 22 (Bloomberg) -- U.K. stocks gained as evidence of
slowing economic growth boosted optimism interest rates won't rise
next year, potentially bolstering corporate earnings. A jump in
U.S. stocks helped British shares extend earlier gains.
	   ``We're not seeing the Christmas boom (in retail sales) people
were expecting,'' said Nat Jolowicz, a fund manager at Quilter &
Co. Ltd., which manages assets worth 3 billion pounds ($5 billion).
That and slower economic growth, ``take a little bit of pressure
off interest rates.''
	   The U.K.'s benchmark FT-SE 100 Index rose 15.0 points, or 0.30
percent, to 5035.3. Among retailers, depressed by evidence of slow
Christmas sales, Boots Co. Plc dropped 20.5p to 860.5, Great
Universal Stores Plc fell 13p to 723 and Kingfisher Plc declined
13.5p to 829.5.
	   Retailers have been left with 3 billion pounds of unsold stock
after slow seasonal sales, according to a report by the Centre for
Economics and Business Research, cited in the Independent.
	   In further evidence of slowing growth, the government cut its
estimate of third-quarter growth to 0.8 percent from an earlier
estimate of 0.9 percent growth.
	   Still, ``what's bad news for some is good news for others,''
Jolowicz said. Poor retail sales mean the Bank of England may not
raise interest rates early next year, easing the debt burden on
many companies and boosting profit.
	   Land Securities Plc and British Land Co. both gained as falling
bond yields make property investments more attractive. Institutions
often buy buildings as long term investments if the yield on
property is higher than long-term bond yields.
	   Land Securities rose 12.5p to 969, while British Land gained 15p
to 668. The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds fell to
6.25 percent today from 6.32 percent on Wednesday last week.
	   Jolowicz has bought utilities over the last week on the prospect
long-term interest rates won't go any higher, increasing the appeal
of utilities which tend to offer steady dividend yields.
	   All the same, some power generators fell after the Financial
Times reported that competition in the U.K. electricity supply
market could be delayed beyond April. National Power Plc fell 9p to
576 and Scottish Power Plc fell 10p to 516.
	   U.K. interest rates are likely to rise once more next year,
probably no more than 25 basis points, said John Smith, an equity
strategist at Henry Cooke Lumsden.
	   Other stocks extended earlier gains after U.S. stocks opened
higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was last up 0.90 percent
at 7826.04. The Dow fell 1.15 percent Friday, paring earlier
declines which saw it 2.5 percent lower at the close of U.K.
trading.
	   Among companies traded in the U.S., Glaxo Wellcome Plc rose 28p
to 1422 and SmithKline Beecham Plc gained 15p to 622.
	   Gains this morning were checked by a slump in Asian markets
overnight. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 2.24 percent, while
Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped 3.37 percent.
	   Rolls-Royce Plc advanced 6.75p to 227.75 after the Financial
Times reported it may be in settlement talks with a Panamanian
company which claims the engine-maker failed to pay promised
commissions. Aerospace Engineering Design Corp. dropped the court
action in the case which involves a 20 billion-pound sale to the
Saudi Arabian Air Force.
	   Legal & General Group Plc leaped 29.5p to 509.5 after Credit
Lyonnais Laing recommended investors switch out of rival Prudential
Corp. and into Legal & General. Shares in Prudential fell 12p to
721.
	   BTR Plc fell 1.25p to 183.25 after the Mail on Sunday said the
industrial, transportation and construction company is close to an
agreement to sell its bottle-making business to the U.S.-based
packaging maker Owens-Illinois Inc. for 700 million pounds ($1.1
billion). BTR has said it will sell one-third of its businesses to
concentrate on engineering.
	   Shares in National Westminster Bank Plc gained 11p to 1021 after
the Times, London reported that Barclays Plc has halted talks on a
merger with NatWest. Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, told
the paper a merger had to be between ``consenting adults,'' and
NatWest's senior management had ``given no sign of being
interested'' in the idea. Barclays was unchanged at 1619.
	   ``Barclays' may end up making an aggressive bid for NatWest,''
Morris-Jones said. Still, Barclays' Taylor said there are ``other
fish in the sea'' than NatWest, while he remained convinced a
merger would help both banks.
	   British Aerospace Plc gained 8p to 1689 after it was recommended
in the Sunday Times. The aerospace company will finish a great year
with an announcement today on the Eurofighter agreement, the paper
said.
