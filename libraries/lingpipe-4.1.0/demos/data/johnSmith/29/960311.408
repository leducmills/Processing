c.1996 Roll Call
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
	   ``Push polls,'' though an old staple in the campaigning arsenal,
are the newest whipping post of the 1996 election, reviled as a
sleazy way of pushing negative information on unsuspecting voters.
	   And two members of Congress have introduced bills to force
campaigns behind the tactic to own up to it.
	   Both claiming to be victims of push polls in their own
districts, Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Tom Petri (R-Wis.)
are exploring ways to ward off such polls by amending the Federal
Election Campaign Act , which regulates campaign spending and
advertising but is completely silent on the subject of polling.
	   Their bills have been around since last year but they say
they've received a boost from the PR lavished on push polling since
the Iowa contretemps over presidential candidate Steve Forbes's
accusation that Sen. Bob Dole's (R-Kan.) campaign was using the
tactic against him.
	   The idea behind push polls is a simple one: Under the guise of
conducting a poll, a campaign will telephone voters and offer up
negative information about the opposition.
	   For example, if a person called stated a preference for Democrat
John Smith, the pollster might ask whether Smith would still be the
preferred choice if ``you knew he used drugs...was soft on
crime...or had driven drunk.''
	   Republican Jeb Bush is another famous casualty of push polling.
During his unsuccessful 1994 gubernatorial bid in Florida against
incumbent Gov. Lawton Chiles (D), a Washington telephone bank
called several thousand seniors and attacked Bush under the
auspices of a phony senior citizens' group and a nonexistent
tax-fairness coalition.
	   After a state Senate committee began investigating the matter
and serving up subpoenas last year, Chiles's gang admitted to
knowing about the calls, but no one seems to know who penned the
scripts that ripped into Bush.
	   Members and their consultants are quick to insist that such
polls are commonplace, though no one is willing to own up to
conducting them.
	   Maloney, for instance, says she was the victim of such tactics
in 1994 during her successful campaign against GOP City
Councilmember Charles Millard. In that race, Maloney charges,
anonymous calls were placed to voters in key areas of her New York
City district providing false information about her positions.
	   Voters living in rent-stabilized apartments, she says, were
called by a fictitious tenants group, whose pollsters stated
incorrectly that she was opposed to rent control.
	   Although she says she can't trace those calls directly to her
opponent's campaign, Maloney last year authored legislation that
would require ``disclosure of who is paying for these attack
calls.''
	   ``We're all too familiar with the `Paid for the Joe Smith for
Congress' disclaimer that we hear on radio or TV or read in
persuasion mail. But phone bank operations , even those that
clearly target a candidate for election or defeat , are not covered
by law,'' Maloney said.
	   The legislation hasn't moved yet, but Maloney has so far
garnered support from co-signers like Reps. Petri, Nydia Velazquez
(D-N.Y.), Major Owens (D-N.Y.), Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.), Ron Klink
(D-Pa.), Lynn Rivers (D-Mich.), Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.), and Sam
Farr (D-Calif.), and aides say she is planning to continue her
crusade against the phony attack calls.
	   Maloney, who notes that legitimate polls and voter ID phone
calls would not be affected by her legislation, says it's a matter
of stopping ``dirty tricks,'' not restricting First
Amendment-protected speech.
	   Petri's approach is slightly different.
	   His bill would require disclosure for all polls, not just push
polls. But the legislation covers only those surveys ``where more
than 400 households are contacted,'' an aide said, since most push
polls target extremely large populations. And polls that are
intended for public release would also be exempted from disclosure
requirements.
	   Reps. Pat Danner (D-Mo.), Rivers, Sue Kelly (R-N.Y.), Ed Pastor
(D-Ariz.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ben Gilman (R-N.Y.), Steve Horn
(R-Calif.), Mark Foley (R-Fla.), Scott Klug (R-Wis.), and Bill
Luther (D-Minn.) and Del. Robert Underwood (D-Guam) are
co-sponsoring the measure.
	   Petri's and Maloney's offices report that they've heard no
outcry from the polling community about their legislation.
	   On the contrary, an aide to Maloney told Roll Call that
pollsters by and large are as outraged as lawmakers at push polling
because it gives their industry a bad name.
	   But pollsters say they are cautious of such legislation and
worry that it could actually have a ``chilling effect'' on their
industry.
	   The Council of American Survey Research Organization , the only
professional organization for survey researchers in the nation ,
has consistently been critical of any regulation of polling and is
considering developing its own set of industry standards to keep
polling clean without putting too many restraints on what pollsters
can and cannot do.
	   But Maloney and Petri won't find their bills sailing through
Congress anytime soon, if their experience before the Federal
Election Commission is any guide.
	   The two members tried last October to persuade the commission to
act on its own , without new legislation from Congress , to close
the legal loophole on phone bank disclosure.
	   But despite their testimony at a hearing last fall and the
recommendation of the FEC's general counsel to adopt their
proposal, the commissioners rejected the idea in a 3-2 vote.
