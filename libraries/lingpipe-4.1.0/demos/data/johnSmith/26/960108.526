
	   ROCKVILLE CENTRE, N.Y. , Despite warnings of an approaching
blizzard, four determined duck hunters wrapped themselves in the
security of experiece Sunday morning and ventured out in search of
mallards. They loaded two boats with guns, two propane tanks and
water, then pushed off from Massapequa and into South Oyster Bay.
	   But human experience cannot always control the vagaries of
nature. When the blizzard hit much earlier than the hunters had
expected, they found themselves stranded, beholden to ice floes,
low tide and an enveloping blanket of howling whiteness. It was not
until late Sunday night that salvation arrived, in the form of a
Coast Guard helicopter's tethered rescue bucket, swaying in the
night wind.
	   The rescue followed an agonizing contest between the elements
and the coordinated efforts of the Coast Guard and the Nassau
County police. The greatest support, however, may have come from
nature herself, as a calm came over the storm at a critical moment.
	   Michael Smith, one of the hunters, said, ``My uncle said the
Lord was looking down on us and decided to break the weather for an
hour.''
	   Smith, 37, a New York City firefighter, said Monday that he and
his companions , his father, John Smith, 69, of Massapequa; John
Perro, 31, of Williston Park, N.Y.; and Paul Minervini, 48, of
Merrick, N.Y. , left the shore at 10:00 a.m. feeling well prepared.
They were wearing waders and several layers of clothing and were in
vessels he called ``the Cadillac of duck boats.'' Also on board was
a black Labrador named Beau.
	   After only an hour, and with only two mallards bagged, the
hunters realized the storm was coming faster than anticipated.
``You could see it coming,'' Michael Smith said. ``The wind was
pushing up and the flurries were blowing harder.''
	   But ice floes were blocking their route back. As they tried
other paths, the tide went out, the boats ran aground and the
hunters lost their sense of location. ``I knew because of my
experience we weren't going anywhere,'' Smith said.
	   The men tied the boats together and gathered under the canvas of
one boat, using a propane tank to provide heat and gallows humor to
pass the time. But Smith was concerned about his father. John
Smith, a retired firefighter, is tough, he said, but he has a
pacemaker. Using a cellular phone, the son dialed 911.
	   Within an hour, Petty Officer Manny Puri of the Coast Guard's
Jones Beach Station had established a telephonic code with Smith:
When Puri transmitted a series of 9s that flashed on the phone's
display panel, the hunters were to fire their guns and shine their
flashlights. ``It was the only way we could pinpoint their
location,'' Puri said.

 Officials lighted flares, sounded sirens and flashed the blue
lights of two rescue boats. Meanwhile, two Coast Guardsmen in
drysuits stepped onto the ice of the bay to search on foot. But the
going was treacherous. The two, Robert Asma and Anthony Ruffule,
fell through the ice several times. One fall ripped Ruffule's suit,
drenching him with freezing water.
	   By now more than a foot of snow had fallen and winds were
blowing at more than 30 miles per hour. On the boat, one propane
tank had run dry and the battery in Smith's phone was dying.
	   Then, around 9:30 p.m., the primitive process of elimination
worked.
	   ``I saw a flare!,'' Smith shouted into his phone. ``I saw a
flare!''
	   About the same time, an officer on a Nassau County boat saw the
beam of a hunter's flashlight. Their location was pinpointed, near
a piece of land called Squaw Island.
	   Puri called the Coast Guard's air station in Brooklyn to request
a helicopter. The pilot, Lt. John Knotts, later admitted to initial
reluctance. ``People don't normally fly in a blizzard,'' he said.
	   The helicopter took flight eastward with the pilot using the
streetlights along Long Island's southern coast to guide him. At
the same time, a temporary peace came to the storm. Visibility
improved enough for Michael Smith to see the lights of homes along
the shore.
	   Then he looked to the sky, where he saw another light. It was
coming for him, his friends and his father.
