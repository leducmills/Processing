Mass. cancer patient had her license revoked in California, after
being convicted of stealing drugs from a home-bound patient and two
hospitals, records show.
	   According to the California Board of Registered Nursing,
Shalimar A. Ellis lost her license on March 28, 1993, after she was
convicted of stealing prescription drugs for herself and others in
San Diego County in 1991 and 1992.
	   On Tuesday, Ellis, 40, of Taunton, Mass., plead innocent to five
charges that she stole morphine from 52-year-old cancer patient
John Smith and replaced it with a substance police believe to be
grape Kool-Aid.
	   Ellis, whose bail was reduced to $10,000 cash on Wednesday, is
being held in the house of correction. She also faces June 17
charges of passing out a stolen prescription in Bridgewater.
	   Authorities believe Ellis began working in Massachusetts in the
last year and may have falsified her Massachusetts license
application, said Halifax Sgt. James Keene.
	   Ellis' Massachusetts employer, Centrus Home Health Care in
Plymouth, said it had run extensive criminal background checks on
her in Massachusetts and Rhode Island but not in California because
there was no indication on her application that it was necessary.
	   California officials issued Ellis a license Oct. 31, 1980 and
revoked it following a series of convictions and investigations.
	   In 1990 and 1991 while working as a registered nurse, Ellis was
caught stealing prescription drugs from Grossmont Hospital in La
Mesa, Calif., and Balboa Naval Hospital in San Diego.
	   In 1992, while working as a home health care nurse, authorities
found that she had stolen a prescription from a patient and
re-filled it for her own use. She paid a $200 fine, served a day in
jail on the charges.
