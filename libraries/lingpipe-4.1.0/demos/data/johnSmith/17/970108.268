

	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. , Say this for the good folks of
Jacksonville: They are decent enough to understand how much they
owe to Morten Andersen.
	   Simply put, had Atlanta's Andersen, as reliable a field goal
kicker as has ever lived, made the place-kicking equivalent of a
3-foot putt on the last day of the season, the Jaguars would be as
forgotten as that old hula hoop lying around the garage. There
would be enough leftover Gator talk to keep these pigskin freaks
happy.
	   But Andersen shanked that 31-yarder, and that put the Jaguars in
the playoffs. Next up were Shock The World I (Buffalo) and Shock
The World II (Denver), and the second-year team now stands one game
away from the Super Bowl.
	   And don't think anyone in this town has forgotten good ol'
Morten.
	   ``I think that Morten Andersen wanted to send Christmas cards to
everyone in Jacksonville,'' suggests Rick Sheets, who manages an
establishment known as the Mandarin Ale House. ``Now he's getting
death threats from Buffalo and Denver.''
	   ``I couldn't bear to watch,'' says Jacksonville resident Jerry
Bird, a Jaguars season ticket-holder. ``I've seen that man kick too
many from close in.''
	   So Bird simply put his head down into his hands. He figured it
had been a pretty good season for his Jags, but that it just wasn't
meant to be. And then ...
	   ``I heard the roar of the crowd,'' Bird recalls, ``and then I
saw Morten on his back. I thought for sure it was roughing the
kicker. So even then, I wasn't sure what was happening.''
	   What was happening was that the Jaguars were going to the
playoffs.
	   Bird was hardly the only paying customer who didn't watch the
Andersen muff.
	   ``To be honest,'' says Tom Correia, a Raynham transplant and
season ticket-holder, ``I walked out. I thought, `Morten Andersen,
he's one of the great place-kickers ever. A guy next to me had a
radio, and he started screaming, `He missed it! He missed it!' And
then it started to get crazy.''
	   ``I was in here working,'' says Mike Callahan, the kitchen
manager of Sneakers, a sports bar partly owned by Jaguars
man-mountain Tony Boselli. ``I knew the guy hadn't missed one that
close since '89, and when it happened, I don't think people really
(itals)knew(unitals) what happened. There was like a 10-second
delay in here before the place exploded. There was a local TV crew
in here, and they said it was very good TV.''
	   Understand that the Jaguars, while a very important local item,
have no football monopoly in this town, which is understandable for
a franchise that is in only its second season , granted, an
improbable second season , and started life as a 4-12 also-ran
before creeping into the playoffs at 9-7 in 1996 and then toppling
postseason perennials Buffalo and Denver.
	   Before anyone here ever heard of Tom Coughlin or Mark Brunell,
there were the Seminoles of Florida State and there were the Gators
of Florida, mostly the Gators. The absolute best thing that can be
said about the Jaguars at the present time is that they have
managed to keep people from talking about those national champion
Gators for the full 24 hours. There might now even be a 14-10
split, in favor of the Jags.
	   There (itals)is(unitals) a definite Jaguar fever. Witness the
crowd of 40,000 that greeted the homecoming Jags in the stadium at
1 a.m. following their conquest of the Broncos. ``And there were
probably another 20,000 drinking in the parking lot who didn't
bother to come in,'' maintains Wayne Cone, a Chase Manhattan
Mortgage Co. branch manager.
	   Now if anyone knows just how much the town has taken to the
Jaguars, it would be John Smith, president of ``Sports Mania,'' a
sports merchandise concern. This is a man who walks the walk when
it comes to taking advantage of his financial opportunities.
	   ``We stayed open until 5 a.m. the night after the Denver game,''
Smith points out. ``Subsequent closing hours have been 3 a.m. and 2
a.m. Tuesday he was figuring on staying open until at least 1 a.m.
``You do what it takes,'' Smith says. ``When you get an
opportunity, you seize it.''
	   Smith has been in the business for 20 years, but he has never
seen anything like the two-month circumstance in this town. It
began eight weeks ago with the Georgia-Florida game. After that
came Florida-Florida State I, the Southeastern Conference
championship game between Florida and Alabama, Florida-Florida
State II and now the Jaguars advancing to the AFC Championship
game.
	   The manufacturers cannot , and this is literal , print the
appropriate T-shirts quickly enough. Things were so hot earlier in
the week that Smith distributed 850 vouchers for new Jaguars
playoff T-shirts. He points to a few small piles of ``Do You
Believe In Miracles?'' T-shirts on the floor. ``This morning,'' he
says, ``the stacks were as high as that TV right there.'' Said TV
is at least 15 feet off the ground.
	   People basically want the new stuff, not the generic Jaguar
merchandise, although Smith says that, too, is getting ``swooped
up'' in the frenzy. People looking for specific jerseys are
frustrated because there are none to be found. Smith assures one
disappointed woman that should the Jags win Sunday, a manufacturer
is prepared to ship tons of No. 8s (Brunell) and No. 20s (Natrone
Means) to his store.
	   ``We're beating out anything the Hornets, the Braves, Florida
State, the Gators or the (Miami) Hurricanes ever did,'' he says.
``Before the week is over, we'll exceed our entire Christmas sales,
and that's over a period of four weeks.''
	   Smith's eyes start twinkling when he thinks about the
possibilities should the Jags beat the Patriots.
	   ``I think the appetite will consume 250,000 pieces in that
case,'' Smith says, ``and that's just shirts. Hats are another
matter. And sweatshirts.''
	   ``The story is that it's just a great football town,'' says Don
Ellison, a stockbroker who has lived elsewhere in the South. ``Pop
Warner, high school, college, and now the pros. This town genuinely
loves football.''
	   ``If you come here,'' says Correia, ``you've got to like
football. Before the Jags, it was either the Seminoles or the
Gators, and you (itals)had(unitals) to make a choice.''
	   Now the choice is to love the Jaguars or to adore them, all the
while remembering that the key man in this fairy tale is not owner
Wayne Weaver, not coach Tom Coughlin, not dazzling quarterback
Brunell or anyone else.
	   ``This `Do You Believe In Miracles?' thing?'' Smith inquires.
``Morten Andersen missed that field goal. (itals)That's(unitals)
your real miracle.''
