	   When I was in high school, whenever I had a crush on someone new
(always unrequited), I doodled my name in the margins of my
notebook , with his last name, to see how it looked. Jean Shaw.
Jean Ruiz. Jean Carlton. I fantasized about generic desirable
married last names , usually WASPy, sometimes based on admired
fictional males. I assumed I'd be married and renamed by the age of
25, like my mother was.
	   But I didn't get married and I didn't get married and finally,
at age 37, I got married. By then, it wouldn't have occurred to me
to take someone else's name. To give up your name seemed like the
worst betrayal of your sex.
	   In fact, when my best friend and sister in feminism told me she
was getting married (again) and was changing her name, I
practically took it personally. She hadn't taken the Japanese name
of her first husband. Why take the Italian name of her second?
	   Elena told me that it was important to him. And that's a common
reason that women give for changing their names at marriage in the
old-fashioned way. Other reasons: I never liked my name anyway; my
name is after all patriarchal, since it's my father's; it will be a
problem when we have kids (the most common explanation); my
relatives insist.
	   Despite the advances of the women's movement, my comrades seem
willing , nay, eager, the wretches , to give up the name that's
served them faithfully through the chaos of childhood, the angst of
adolescence, the struggles toward self-knowledge and
self-fulfillment that mark young adulthood and even middle age.
	   And it's not that my gal pals achieved little while single and
are therefore eager for the illusion of a new identity: I've known
successful actresses and writers who've blithely discarded their
maiden names when love struck. For heaven's sake, we might as well
forget the euphemism ``maiden'' name and call it ``old maid'' name
 that's how we seem to think of it! Or go back to introducing
ourselves as ``Mrs. John Smith.''
	   And aren't we essentially erasing ourselves from the annals of
recorded history? Have you ever tried to look up an old girlfriend?
Forget it. She doesn't exist anymore, not so's you'd know it.
	   On a broader perspective, why do women not see the irony in
automatically giving their children daddy's name? Surely in most
cases, when a marriage breaks up, the kids stay with mom and
sometimes never see the old man again. How many kids are running
around saddled with the moniker of a deadbeat dad?
	   As for those trendy hyphenated (or double) noms de mariage: Quel
copout! C'mon: Is she Hillary Rodham or Hillary Clinton in a pinch?
Tucked away in the middle and inevitably lost in the shuffle, the
birth name is soon seen for what it is: a token gesture, a
testimony not to proud self-identity but to dithering ambivalence.
	   Further proof of the hollowness of the gestures: I don't see any
men taking on hyphenated handles, or any women putting their maiden
name triumphantly after their married name, or many kids with names
like Chelsea Rodham-Clinton or Chelsea Clinton-Rodham , and if
there were, when THEY get married, I shudder to think.
	   But I realize that my choice, to keep my own name, is harder for
women with children. So I have a compromise solution. Let's agree,
gals, to adapt the Icelandic system, with one adjustment. In that
cold country, a newborn is given its father's first name as its
last name; boy babies get a ``son'' appendage and girls a
``dottir'' ending. Nobody changes her name at marriage! Thus, for
example, Erik Leifsson and his charming wife, Ingrid Helgisdottir,
are the proud parents of Hans Eriksson and Pia Eriksdottir. But
let's amend it so that little Pia gets mama's name , Pia
Ingridsdottir! I bet that little Pia will grow up well-adjusted and
strong.
	   My turncoat friend Elena's second marriage, by the way, ended in
divorce. The good news is she remarried but came to her senses and
didn't take on her third husband's (all-American) appellation. The
bad news is, wouldn't you know it, she kept her second hubby's
name. It's a wonder she's not completely schizophrenic. But there
is hope for her , she's thinking of legally switching to her
mother's maiden name, which reflects her Jewish roots and has quite
a ring to it: Goldfinger!
	   As for me, I wonder, should I set a good example for future
generations? Following Elena's lead, I could change my name to Jean
Harris. But that evokes images of the Scarsdale diet doctor. Or I
could kick off the New Icelandic Plan , Jean Murielsdaughter. Cute
but cumbersome. I could even follow the example of my own
oft-married maternal grandmother, who whipped up a fanciful last
name out of thin air , Lyra. But I'll stick with Schiffman. Leave
it to a future generation to implement a better system. Carry on,
sisters.
