	   Detroit, June 12 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s new
luxury car, the Cadillac Catera, should reach its 25,000-unit sales
goal this year, though analysts say it's a mixed start for the car
that aims to attract younger buyers to the luxury brand.
	   The European-made Catera debuted late last year as a different
kind of Cadillac: smaller, cheaper and sportier. It's the
division's first model in the growing entry-luxury category
dominated by import models such as the Lexus ES300, BMW 3-series
and Volvo 850.
	   The car, which received a boost when the lease price was cut in
January, will probably end up in the middle of the pack for
entry-luxury sales, Cadillac executives said. Catera is hitting
other marks as well, they add: Buyers are in their late 40s, down
from the brand's average of 66; 46 percent are women, above the 28
percent average; and 30 percent didn't already own a Cadillac.
	   ``That's pretty good coming out of the chute,'' said Cadillac
General Manager John Smith. ``We're pleased with what the car is
doing for us and our dealers.''
	   Yet Catera's first-year sales goal was modest, analysts said,
and some question whether the model really is drawing
non-traditional Cadillac buyers. Competitors, meanwhile, say the
car hasn't made much of an impact on their sales.
	   ``I think we're talking about different customers'' shopping for
Catera and Lexus, said Mike Michels, a spokesman for Toyota Motor
Corp.'s Lexus brand.
	   The Catera, priced at $30,000 to $36,000, is a six-cylinder,
rear-wheel-drive sedan based on the Omega from GM's European Opel
division and built in Russelsheim, Germany. Sales began in October.
	   The car is portrayed in ads as the Cadillac that ``zigs'' -- a
different car for a well-known brand that has seen its buyers age
and its sales fall as traditional American luxury cars lose out to
sport utility vehicles and sportier imports.
	   While Cadillac sales fell 6.2 percent last year to 170,379 from
1995, the division's DeVille remains among the most popular U.S.
luxury cars. Division sales this year rose 0.2 percent to 71,354
through May, helped by the 9,934 Catera sales.
	   Another traditional American luxury brand, Ford Motor Co.'s
Lincoln division, has seen a similar sales decline in recent years
and is taking a different tack to draw younger buyers. Lincoln is
introducing a luxury sport utility vehicle, the Navigator, which
debuts in July and is a dressed-up version of Ford's wildly
successful Expedition.
	   Catera's competition, including Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus
division, Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes and Volvo AB, all have posted
sales gains this year despite their first contender from an
American automaker.
	   ``All of Catera's main competition are having banner years, so
it's not having big impact,'' said Wes Brown, an auto industry
consultant with Nextrend in Thousand Oaks, California.
	   Brown questioned whether the car was hitting its age targets as
the company claims. ``I don't see anyone younger than their 50s
driving it,'' he said.
	   The car has received good marks for quality and performance. The
main challenge remains getting younger buyers to enter a Cadillac
dealership, Brown said. The division has 775 of its 1,546 dealers
doing just that. All had to attend ``Catera College'' to learn tips
on improving customer service and selling to younger buyers.
	   ``We've got a lot of ducks around here,'' said Tom Williamson, a
Cadillac dealer in Miami, referring to the cartoon bird that is
prominently displayed in Catera advertisements.
	   Heavy national and regional advertising helped the dealership
sell about 25 Cateras a month, a third of its monthly volume. About
half of the Catera sales are to non-traditional Cadillac buyers,
Williamson said. ``We're doing very well with the car,'' he said.
	   Cadillac cut the Catera's lease price by about $50, to $399 a
month, in January, a move that helped boost sales. It also
corrected problems with side airbags in the spring.
	   Still, Catera's competitors aren't expressing concern.
	   ``It certainly isn't taking any sales from us,'' said Michels,
the Lexus spokesman. Sales of the ES300, which starts at about
$30,000 and sells at $34,000 with popular equipment, have jumped 42
percent so far this year to 23,521.
	   Michels cited Lexus research showing that ES buyers don't
usually consider Cadillacs when they shop, while nearly half of
Catera's buyers are trading in other Cadillacs.
	   Cadillac's Smith says the car is building demand by scratch, no
doubt helped by the world's largest automaker's marketing clout.
Cadillac is building toward 2001, when the next-generation Catera
will be introduced. It's expected to be a larger, U.S.-made car
with bigger sales than the current model. The challenge remains
convincing buyers that Cadillac really can ``zig.''
	   ``That kind of change is just not going to happen overnight,''
said Brown.
