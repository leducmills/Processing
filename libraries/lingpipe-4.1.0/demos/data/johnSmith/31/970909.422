	   Frankfurt, Sept. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Neither General Motors Corp.
nor the United Auto Workers union won a yearlong series of
skirmishes, GM Executive Vice President G. Richard Wagoner said.
	   ``The resolutions haven't been a massive win for either side,''
said Wagoner, in an interview at the Frankfurt Auto Show.
	   The Detroit-based union, which represents most of the
Detroit-based automaker's 229,000 U.S. hourly workers, launched
four plant strikes against GM in 1997 and several others last year.
The walkouts cost the company $490 million in first-quarter profits
and at least temporarily derailed GM's plans to boost its slumping
U.S. market share.
	   There has been labor peace for the last few weeks, as the two
sides quietly negotiate at about six of its 125 plants. Wagoner was
cautious about the outlook.
	   Just because most of the local union contracts are settled
``doesn't mean other things don't arise,'' he said.
	   GM still is aiming to boost profits and cut its vehicle
production labor costs by about 5 percent, even though the union
forced the company to hire more workers at several plants, he said.
Most of the strikes were over workforce size.
	   ``My primary performance measurement isn't labor hours per
vehicle -- it's can you meet the profit targets,'' he said. ``The
point is we're moving in the right direction.''
	   GM enjoyed higher-than-expected U.S. sales in July and August
after a disappointing June. Wagoner wouldn't predict whether the
company will be able to boost its U.S. market share beyond the
current 31 percent. He did say improved availability of its newest
cars and its full-size trucks should help.
	   The company hasn't changed its 1997 estimate that U.S. total car
and truck sales will be 15.2 million or 15.3 million.
	   ``We don't see any reason why things should fall on their face''
later this year, he said.
	   GM's incentives should decline in the third and fourth quarter
from the $1,066 per-unit average in the second quarter, Wagoner
said. That was 53 percent higher than the year-earlier level of
$695. Chrysler Corp. boosted its rebates last week.
	   GM is selling more of its 14 all-new models, which helps reduce
incentive spending, Wagoner said. These new cars and trucks, such
as the Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Intrigue cars and the
Pontiac Tran Sport minivan, sell with little or no incentive money.
	   Also today, the automaker introduced another new model, the 1998
Cadillac Seville, at the Frankfurt show. It's the first time GM has
unveiled a North American-built car outside the U.S. GM wants to
boost Seville exports to capture more of the premium car market
outside North America, which should grow to 4 million annually from
3 million in five years.
	   The car will cost about $45,000 and will go on sale in December
in North America and Japan, and in March in Europe. The company
hopes to boost Seville sales to 55,000 annually from 35,000 over
five years.
	   Analysts have said it's unclear whether the car can compete with
more established global luxury brands, such as Mercedes and BMW.
John Smith, Cadillac's general manager, said today that it could.
``This is the best Cadillac ever,'' he said.
