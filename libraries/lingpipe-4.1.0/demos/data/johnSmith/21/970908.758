
	   SAN FRANCISCO , Traffic around the San Francisco Bay area crept
along for hours at a time on Monday as a two-day railway strike
left thousands of commuters struggling to get to work and back.
	   ``This was the heaviest traffic I've ever seen,'' said software
company manager Scott Johnston, who commuted on Monday by car pool
to San Francisco from his home in the East Bay town of Lafayette.
``It was so bad that I'm thinking of staying home tomorrow.''
	   On Sunday morning, workers for Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART,
went on strike, shutting down the commuter rail system here that
carries 270,000 riders each weekday.
	   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown Jr. warned at a press
conference on Monday that the strike could ``cripple the city's
economy'' and offered his services as an unofficial mediator.
	   ``I seriously doubt we'll reach an agreement today,'' said a
BART spokesman, Michael Healy. ``But we think if anyone can get the
unions to look realistically at the issues, the mayor can, so we
welcome his help.''
	   Several union leaders and top BART officials met on Monday
afternoon in Brown's office. The key issues in the dispute are
wages and the railroad's two-tier system of employment. Under the
system, new employees work six years to reach journeyman status,
and even then their earnings are limited to 90 percent of the
salaries of colleagues who have more seniority.
	   Without BART, commuters on Monday morning turned to buses,
ferries, and cars as they struggled to get to work on time.
	   ``It was an hourlong wait to get on the ferry,'' said Andrea
Wright, who normally drives to her job as a hospital manager but
chose to travel by boat to avoid the gridlock. ``Every seat was
taken.''
	   The backup was the worst on the Bay Bridge, which connects San
Francisco and Oakland. The Bay Bridge on normal days is the busiest
toll bridge in the nation, and by 4:30 a.m. on Monday, traffic on
it had slowed to crawl, said Jeff Weiss, a spokesman for the
California Department of Transportation.
	   ``I've never seen such heavy traffic that early before,'' Weiss
said, estimating that an additional 50,000 cars were on local roads
because of the strike. ``The problem is the Bay Bridge is already
beyond capacity.''
	   Major San Francisco employers like Bank of America, Levi Strauss
& Co., and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said they were encouraging
employees to work from home or during off hours in order to bypass
rush-hour traffic.
	   ``There are definitely fewer people in the office today,'' said
Robert Wynne, a spokesman for Bank of America, which employs 9,300
people in San Francisco. ``Some people are using the strike as an
excuse to try telecommuting or take the day off and wait and see if
they'll resolve it.''
	   In the afternoon, Officer Ruth O'Brien of the California Highway
Patrol described ``seriously long lines at the ferries.'' But she
added: ``Traffic on the Bay Bridge looked light.''
	   O'Brien said that traffic was backed up on major highways around
the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum, but that much of that gridlock
could probably be attributed to a football game scheduled for
Monday night.
	   If the strike drags on, the economic impact will become a major
concern for Brown, said his press secretary, Kandace Bender.
	   ``Common sense tells you that if 270,000 people are unable to
get to San Francisco in a timely fashion, that will have an impact
on the economy. It just will,'' Bender said. ``It's a horrendous
inconvenience.''
	   Sympathies among more than a dozen commuters interviewed this
morning were divided, but the majority sided with BART management.
	   ``I think it's a tragedy, really, that the union is hung up upon
squeezing money out of the public,'' said John Smith, a legal
consultant who rode his black BMW motorcycle over the Golden Gate
Bridge to work on Monday. ``The workers are very well paid, and
frankly, greedy.''
	   BART maintenance workers, who belong to the Service Employees
International Union Local 790, earn a base wage of $48,000 a year.
Train operators and station agents, members of the Amalgamated
Transit Union Local 1555, make $40,900, placing them among the
highest paid transit workers in the country.
	   Members of both unions rejected an offer from management that
would have raised their pay 3 percent a year for three years.
	   BART rider Stacey Richman, 27, who works for United Way, said
she supports the union. ``Just because it's inconvenient for us
doesn't make it wrong for them to look out for their interests,''
Richman said, ``and I do think the two-tier system is wrong.''
