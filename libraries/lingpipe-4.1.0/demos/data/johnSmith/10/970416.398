	   San Jose, California, April 16 (Bloomberg) -- Avant! Corp.
shares fell 22 percent today after prosecutors charged the software
company and six of its executives stole the source code for their
computer chip-design software from their principal rival, Cadence
Design Systems Inc.
	   The shares fell 2 5/8 to 9 7/8 in mid-afternoon trading of 2.1
million shares. Yesterday, Avant! plunged 12 to 12 1/2 on news that
its chief executive was arrested for conspiracy and theft of trade
secrets.
	   The felony charges were filed by the Santa Clara County district
attorney's office after a two-and-a-half year investigation. The
accused Avant! officers are all former employees of Cadence. If
convicted, each defendant could receive as much as seven years in
prison.
	   The criminal complaint and 20-page sworn statement filed with it
describe a six-year criminal conspiracy.
	   Today Avant! spokesman Don Davis repeated yesterday's denial of
any wrongdoing, and expressed confidence the defendants will be
exonerated.
	   ``We need to cut through the hysteria and get to the bottom of
this,'' he said.
	   Davis said CEO Gerry Hsu and other executives were bailed out of
jail last night, and are at the office.
	   ``We fervently deny that we have Cadence software code in any of
our products today,'' he said. Avant! blamed the charges on false
allegations by Cadence. He said Avant! sells many products
untainted by the charges.
	   ``Over the last several years, the company has expanded its
product offerings to include many lines not covered by the theft
allegations,'' said Davis.
	   Prosecutors allege that they found stolen copies of confidential
Cadence software when they executed a search warrant at Avant!'s
office on Dec. 5, 1995. They also allege that Avant! executives
secretly paid thousands of dollars in laundered funds to former
Cadence employee Mitch Igusa in return for stealing software source
codes from Cadence. Avanti! is also accused of hiding these
payments from Coopers & Lybrand LLP, its outside auditor.
	   Cadence and Avant! compete in the market for electronic design
automation software, which is used to speed up computer-chip
design. Prosecutors charge Avant! stole computer code for Cadence's
Symbad, Froute, Groute, Qplace and Vsize technologies, and
incorporated them into its own products.
	   Prosecutors allege that former Cadence employee Mitch Igusa
e-mailed about 6 million bytes of data in just four messages from
his company account at Cadence to his personal Internet account on
Sept. 15, 1994, the day before he resigned. Over the prior three
months, he never e-mailed any file larger than ten kilobytes, they
allege.
	   ``Persons stealing information from their employers have moved
information from their computers at work to other computers off
site by transferring computer files electronically as e-mail
messages,'' wrote senior criminal investigator John Smith in his
affidavit in support of the charges.
	   Smith also said he discovered source code for Cadence computer
programs at Igusa's home during a search on Nov. 10, 1974.
	   ``In a number of instances Cadence copyright notices embedded in
the source code had been removed,'' wrote Smith.
	   The defendants are: Avant! Corp. and six employees, all of whom
previously worked for Cadence: Chih-Liang Eric Cheng; Yun-Chung
Eric Cho, also known as Eric Cho, now a director of Avant!; Gerald
Chien-Kuo Hsu, aka Gerry Hsu, Avant!'s president and CEO; Shiaoli
Leigh Huang, now Avant!'s director of business operations; Yuh-Zen
Liao, aka Y.Z. Liao, now Avant!'s vice president of technology, and
Stephen Tzyh-Lih Wuu, now Avant!'s vice president of engineering.
	   Also charged was Mitsuru Igusa aka Mitch Igusa, a former Cadence
employee not employed by Avant!.
	   Avant!'s Wuu allegedly wrote that he ``created'' more than
47,000 lines of computer code for Avant! in the 19 days between
Feb. 22, 1991 and March 13, 1991 in a diary entry found during a
search of his office. Cadence programmer Jien-Shen Tsai told
investigators that was impossible to write so much code in such a
short time, saying 100 lines a day was the typical number.
	   All are set to be arraigned in San Jose Municipal Court at 9:30
a.m. on Friday.
	   Cadence representatives said the criminal charges back up their
claims in a 1995 federal civil suit brought against Avant! for
stealing trade secrets.
	   Last month, a federal judge ruled that Avant! could continue to
sell some products that Cadence claims use stolen source code,
until a civil trial is held in the case.
