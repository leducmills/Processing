	   Detroit, April 14 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s
first-quarter profit more than doubled, topping expectations, as it
boosted U.S. production from the strike-plagued year-ago quarter
and racked up its best earnings in North America in more than a
decade.
	   GM said profit from continuing operations rose to $1.80 billion,
or $2.30 a share, from $800 million, or 93 cents.
	   The company was expected to earn $2.09 a share, the average
estimate in a survey of 13 analysts by First Call Corp.
	   ``It was somewhat better than I expected,'' said Burnham
Securities analyst David Healy. Earnings in Europe and at financial
subsidiary General Motors Acceptance Corp. were higher than he had
estimated, he said.
	   GM said car and truck earnings in North America rose to $764
million from a loss of $279 million. The North American earnings
were still lower than he expected, Healy said.
	   In addition, the company's repurchase of 27 million shares for
$1.6 billion helped boost the per-share figure by spreading the
earnings over fewer shares, he said.
	   Revenue rose to $42.3 billion from $39.2 billion.
	   GM's international car and truck business earned $317 million,
down from $432 million.
	   In the most recent quarter, the company booked a one-time gain
of $55 million, or 7 cents a share, from Volkswagen AG's payment to
settle GM's industrial espionage lawsuit against VW. GM also
recorded a one-time charge of $50 million, also 7 cents, to close a
New Jersey parts plant.
	   In the year-earlier first quarter, GM recorded a gain of $72
million, or 7 cents a share, on the sale of a partial interest in
its Hughes Electronics subsidiary's DirecTV business.
	   Also, a 17-day strike at two Ohio brake plants in March 1996 cut
the automaker's North American production and reduced earnings by
$900 million, or $1.20 a share.
	   Excluding the strike impact and the one-time gains and charges,
profit from continuing operations rose to $1.79 billion from $1.02
billion.
	   The company's net profit margin rose to 4.8 percent from 2.3
percent, but was still below the company goal of 5 percent.
	   ``It's clear that we are headed in the right direction to
further strengthen the corporation's financial performance,'' said
Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr.
	   GM shares rose 7/8 to 53 7/8 in midmorning trading.
