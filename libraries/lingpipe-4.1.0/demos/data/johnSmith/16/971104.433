	   Washington, Nov. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The nightmare traffic jam on
the nation's largest railroad, the Union Pacific, is taking a toll
on the U.S. economy by delaying coal deliveries, causing
bottlenecks in the food supply, and hindering factory shipments.
	   As a result, prices could rise even as overall U.S. growth cools
with the weather. ``Our coal stocks are certainly below where we
thought they'd be,'' said Mark Werner, superintendent of fuels at
City Public Service of San Antonio, Texas. ``We're pulling in our
horns and getting ready for winter by making arrangements for fuel
oil and alternate sources of coal.''
	   An expected record grain harvest is likely to compound the rail
backup. And General Motors Corp. Chairman John Smith Jr. recently
warned that sales and production at the world's biggest auto
manufacturer could be hurt by the railroad crisis.
	   The problems at Dallas-based Union Pacific Corp., which
intensified in the spring after it completed the acquisition of the
ailing Southern Pacific Rail Corp., persist in slowing freight. The
railroad reported that it held up 348 trains in the week ended Oct.
24 because of a shortage of locomotives, crews or space on the
tracks. Average train speeds have slowed as a result -- to 13.3
miles per hour that week from 17.9 mph in January.
	   Coal-starved utilities are seeing higher operating costs. Use of
natural gas instead of coal has added $100,000 to $150,000 a day
since September to generating costs, said Andy Ramirez, vice
president for power production at the municipally owned Austin
Electric Utility in Austin, Texas.
	   Prices of consumer goods delivered by rail could also rise if
the congestion causes supplies to dwindle. ``The problem retailers
face is having to pay more to obtain the goods they need on time
for the holiday season'' and that could mean higher prices for
finished goods, said Barnett Banks chief economist Lynn Reaser in
Jacksonville, Florida.
	   Freight logjams, like the Union Pacific's, are symptomatic of an
economy that's been growing at an unsustainable pace since the
fourth quarter of last year, Federal Reserve Gov. Susan Phillips
told reporters today in Chicago.
	   Moreover, a report released today suggests the economy is poised
for more growth in the months ahead. The Conference Board's index
of leading economic indicators rose 0.2 percent in September, the
fifth consecutive month increase, after rising 0.2 percent in
August. Yesterday, figures from the National Association of
Purchasing Management pointed to an increase in factory orders and
output during October.
	   Still, the rail logjam is also a reason ``why we might see some
moderation in growth,'' Phillips said, though for now the Fed
remains on alert for signs of rising prices stemming from unmet
consumer demand.
	   Reaser estimates the Union Pacific's problems could shave
two-tenths of a percentage point from U.S. gross domestic product
in the current fourth quarter, reducing growth to a 2.5 percent
annual rate from 3.5 percent in the third quarter.
	   ``There's bound to be a ripple effect'' on the U.S. economy, Guy
Brenkman, president and chief executive of Peoria, Illinois-based
Pioneer Railcorp, said in an interview. Pioneer's Fort Smith
freight line connects with the Union Pacific.
	   On financial markets today, bonds fell as the U.S. Treasury
began three days of quarterly government securities auctions. The
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/2, pushing up its yield
almost 4 basis points to 6.25 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average, meanwhile, rose 15 points, or 0.19 percent, to close at
7689.13, led by shares of J.P. Morgan & Co.
	   Union Pacific shares fell 1 11/16 today to close at 60 3/8.
	   Several events are at the root of the railroad traffic snarl.
Union Pacific's takeover of Southern Pacific -- much of whose
tracks and equipment were in disrepair -- led to a shortages of
engines and rail cars. Construction delays in Houston have slowed
trains throughout the 36,000-mile system. And a surge in freight
shipments, reflecting the robust economy, added to the backup.
	   To complicate matters, a chain of fatal train accidents brought
Union Pacific's operations and training under closer government
scrutiny. Just last week, the Federal Railroad Administration said
85 state and federal inspectors will comb the railroad's operations
in the Southwest.
	   Union Pacific said in weekly reports it files with government
regulators that it's unsnarling its traffic tangle. ``We caution
shippers, though, that it could be a while before they will see
improvements,'' Union Pacific spokesman John Bromley said today.
``By the end of this year, we expect to be back to the service
standards we expect this railroad to have.''
	   General Motors today reported October car and truck sales fell
4.0 percent. Before the announcement, industry analysts said the
railroad bottleneck had shaved 1 or 2 percent off GM's October
performance. GM ships about 25,000 cars a day by rail to
distribution centers around the U.S. From there, the vehicles are
typically carried by trucks to dealers.
	   The short supply of rail cars means vehicle delivery times have
climbed 10 percent in the last few months, according to GM
spokesman Tom Klipstine.
	   ``GM is a perfect example,'' said David Greenlaw, an economist
at Morgan Stanley in New York. ``If their vehicles are piling up at
the manufacturing plants because they can't ship them out, even
though demand might be there for new cars, they will be building
such an inventory they will eventually have to cut back on
production.''
	   Delays could get worse before they get better as an unusually
large harvest is set to flood Union Pacific. According to U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates, the U.S. soybean crop will be
a record 2.72 billion bushels this year. The corn harvest could be
the third-largest ever at 9.31 billion bushels, the USDA said.
Farmers planted more acreage than usual this year because grain
inventories were low as the planting approached.
	   Corn production in Kansas, for example, is expected to reach a
record 364.5 million bushels and sorghum grain is expected to reach
273.4 million bushels. ``The size of our crop has collided with
this problem at Union Pacific,'' said Carole Jordan, a spokeswoman
for the Kansas Department of Agriculture.
	   As a result, Kansas has given elevator operators permission to
store more than 10 million bushels of grain outside -- a
potentially money-losing move -- as they wait for delayed freight
trains. ``There are some losses in quality when it is stored
outside and there has already been a snowstorm this year,'' Jordan
said.
	   Ronald Maas, executive director of the Nebraska Wheat Board,
said a grain elevator operator in his state incurred thousands of
dollars of daily fees when a rail car he filled with grain sat on
the tracks waiting for an outbound train. ``We're talking about a
lot money,'' Maas said, adding rail delays are costing farmers 10
to 20 cents per bushel.
	   The problems seem most acute at utilities, which depend on coal
from Wyoming's Powder River Basin, a major source of freight in the
Union Pacific system. According to U.S. Department of Energy
statistics for 1995, coal-fired power plants provided 43.5 percent
of nation's electric generating capacity.
	   Chuck Linderman of the Edison Electric Institute, a
Washington-based trade association, said one Midwest utility is
receiving about three trains of coal a month instead of the 13 it
booked. ``The situation is very serious in all directions,''
Linderman said. ``Stockpile levels are getting low.''
