	   Detroit, April 9 (Bloomberg) -- Michigan stocks rose for the
first time this week, fueled by gains in Ford Motor Co. and Kmart
Corp.
	   The Bloomberg Michigan Index rose 0.71, or 0.58 percent, to
122.39. The price-weighted index of 117 companies is designed to
reflect the performance of the state's economy.

Poor's 500 Index, which fell 2.05, or 0.32 percent, to 642.19.
	   Ford shares rose 1/8 to 35 3/8. The company said it cut Chairman

Taurus car and F-150 pickup truck.

down from $7.5 million in 1994.
	   Separately, Ford and advertising agency Young & Rubicam Inc.
settled charges by the Federal Trade Commission that the companies
went too far in describing a filter's ability to clean air in a
car's passenger cabin. Ford agreed to avoid broad claims about the
filter system and to have reliable scientific evidence to back any
air-quality claims.
	   Kmart shares rose 1/4 to 9 1/4. U.S. retail sales exceeded

percent from the prior week, the report said.
	   General Motors Corp. was unchanged at 54 5/8. GM Chairman and
