HSBC Holdings 1st-Half Net Rises 11% on Growth at Midland By Peter
Moreira
	   London: HSBC Holdings Plc, the international financial group
that grew out of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., said
first-half net rose a better-than-expected 11 percent on strong
growth at its U.K. bank. Britain's largest bank in terms of assets
said profit attributable to shareholders in sterling rose to 1.76
billion pounds ($2.87 billion) and earnings per share rose 10
percent to 66 pence, compared with 1.59 billion pounds and 60.1
pence earned in the previous first half. HSBC will pay an interim
dividend of 20 pence per share, compared with 15.0 pence a year
earlier. Analysts had anticipated a dividend of 17.9 percent. The
earnings show British banks continue to benefit from strong growth
and low inflation while those in Hong Kong are profiting on record
high levels of mortgage lending and strong economic growth. ``They
were very good numbers and the dividend increase is something that
really catches the eye,'' said Nigel Cobby, an executive director
at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Co. in London.
``Increasingly, the market is recognizing that the banks are in a
different economy.'' HSBC shares in sterling were up as much as 113
pence or 5.3 percent to 2,227.5 pence and were recently at 2,190
pence. Published 11:42 London time. (See story: NI BNK)
GM to Buy Back $2.5 Bln in Stock, Leaves Dividend Unchanged By
Brian Lysaght
	   Detroit: General Motors Corp. said it will repurchase $2.5
billion in stock in its second buyback program in a year. The
company said the shares would be bought back over the next year and
would result in a 4.6 percent reduction in its shares outstanding.
The company repurchased 43.7 million shares beginning last January
in a just-ended $2.5 billion buyback. GM's board of directors,
meeting today, left the company's dividend unchanged, though the
company said it would reconsider other ways in the future to return
cash to shareholders. ``We expect to consider additional programs
in the future, within the framework of the investment requirements
to maintain and grow the business, the overall business climate and
our cash position growing forward,'' Chairman and Chief Executive
John Smith Jr. said in a statement. GM shares fell 1 3/16 to 63 1/4
in early trading. Published 14:54 London time. (See story: NI AUT)
BA 1st-Quarter Profit Falls on Strong Pound, Strike By Peter
Robison
	   London: British Airways Plc's first-quarter profit before a
one-time gain fell 36 percent, hurt by the strong pound and
higher-than-expected lost bookings from a cabin crew strike. Net
income for the three months to June 30 fell to 74 million pounds
($120 million), or 7.9 pence per share, from 115 million pounds, or
11.9 pence. The figure excluded a 130 million-pound one-time gain
from BA's sale of its stake in US Airways Group Inc. The decline
ended a string of increases for BA, the world's most profitable
airline last year, as it grappled with the strike and a stronger
U.K. currency that cut the value of its overseas bookings. ``This
year is a write-off,'' said Chris Avery, an analyst with Paribas
Capital Markets. Like other analysts, Avery said he plans to cut
his full-year profit estimate. BA said the three-day strike,
announced in the last week of the period and carried out last
month, cost 15 million pounds in the quarter and will cost another
110 million pounds in the second quarter. The figures surprised
analysts, who had been expecting total strike costs of about 80
million pounds. British Airways shares fell 21.5 pence, or 3.4
percent, to 618.5 in midday London trading, marking the steepest
decline in the FT-SE index of the biggest 100 U.K. stocks.

Dow Chemical to Buy South Africa's Sentrachem for $445 Million
	   Johannesburg: Dow Chemical Co., the world's fifth-largest
chemical maker, agreed to buy South Africa's Sentrachem Ltd. for
2.07 billion rand ($445 million), strengthening its specialty
chemical and agricultural products. The acquisition values
Sentrachem at 10.50 rand a share, or 33 percent above the 7.92 rand
per share it closed at Friday. Dow, known for its Handi-Wrap and
Saran Wrap brands of plastic film, will add Sentrachem's $1.2
billion in annual sales to its own $20 billion. Dow is raising its
profile in South Africa and returned in 1995, after an eight-year
absence. Like many U.S. companies, Dow left South Africa in the
late 1980s because of the economic sanctions imposed on the white
apartheid regime. It first entered the country in 1959. ``The
acquisition reinforces our strategic direction to enhance Dow's
performance-chemicals portfolio with the addition of Sentrachem's
strong specialty and agricultural chemical businesses,'' said Dow
Chief Executive Officer William Stavropoulos. Dow's purchase is the
second largest by a U.S. company in South Africa since the fall of
apartheid and the election of President Nelson Mandela in 1994.

AO Sibneft's New Notes Offer Tax Break: Financing Business By
Margaret Soares
	   London: AO Sibneft became the latest Russian company to raise
money in the West, finding a way around central bank restrictions
that are blocking corporate Eurobond sales and allowing investors
to avoid a Russian withholding tax. Russia's seventh-largest oil
company sold $125 million of three-year loan participation notes
Friday, managed by Salomon Brothers International. The notes pay a
floating-rate coupon 400 basis points, or 4 percentage points, more
than the three-month London interbank offered rate, now about 5.69
percent. ``Russia's a hot market. People are looking for ways to
invest,'' and the Sibneft bonds give them another option, said
Stephen O'Sullivan, head of emerging markets research at MC
Securities. Many Russian corporations have said they want to sell
Eurobonds, although none has been able to get the approval of
Russia's central bank, while the bank and the Federal Commission
for the Securities Markets are locked in a dispute over who is in
charge of capital markets transactions. The central bank has
approved bond sales by Russian banks, however, because banks are
not in the commission's jurisdiction. Published 11:16 London time.

Pearson 1st-Half Net Rises 55% as One-Time Charges Fall By Dawn
Hayes
	   London: Pearson Plc said first-half net income after one-time
items rose 55 percent, as one-time charges decreased and profits
increased at the Financial Times and Penguin books. Net after
one-time items was 34.4 million pounds ($56 million), compared with
22.2 million pounds in the first half of 1996. The U.K. media and
entertainment company said Mindscape, its ailing U.S. software
unit, performed better than expected and will be profitable by
year-end. Losses at Mindscape and at its educational publishers and
TV units were more than offset by the Financial Times and Penguin.
Pearson said the earnings should be seen as a first step to
improving performance so much that the company's value doubles in
the next five years. Earnings have declined the last three years as
acquisitions have contributed less to profit than expected.
``Certainly there is scope to tighten the running of the ship and
squeeze better returns from the existing businesses,'' said Anthony
de Larrinaga, media analyst at Panmure Gordon & Co., ``but whether
those targets can be achieved within that timescale without more
significant restructuring is another question.'' First-half results
exceeded analysts' expectations and Pearson shares rose as much as
4.2 percent to 694 pence, where they recently traded. Published

ECONOMY AND MARKETS
German Economy: Weaker Deutsche Mark Propels Expansion By Heather
Harris and Julie Bain
	   Bonn: German industrial output rebounded in June as a weak
deutsche mark helped factories overcome sluggish domestic demand by
increasing their overseas sales. Production in Germany rose 1.4
percent in June from May, the Economics Ministry said, and
increased 1.4 percent from a year ago. The monthly increase was
greater than the 1.3 percent increase expected by 15 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey. Manufacturers increased output 1.2 percent
in June as the mark's 17 percent drop this year against the dollar
helped make them more competitive overseas. Output of durable
goods, such as cars, televisions and washing machines, rose 5.2
percent. ``It's just as well the deutsche mark is where it is --
German industry has little else going for it,'' said Alison
Cottrell, an economist at PaineWebber International Ltd. in London.
The mark slumped to 1.8726 per U.S. dollar today, its lowest since
November 1989. Although the cheap mark is helping German industry,
it's also fueling speculation the Bundesbank may push up interest
rates to halt the currency's decline. Published 13:59 London time.

Monday's European Markets: Stocks Plunge, Bonds Mixed By Larry King
	   London: Stocks plunged and bonds declined in Europe as trading
got under way in August -- a month that could see interest rates go
up in three major markets. The policy-making committees of the Bank
of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve both meet soon, and the
policy-setting panel of Germany's Bundesbank will need to make a
decision about whether to fix, let float or raise its main money
market rate. Rate increases by any one of the central banks could
set stocks and bonds back in at least some markets. Increases by
all three would do serious damage. In the meantime, stocks and
bonds are suffering mostly because opinion is divided on which, if
any, of the central banks will move. ``I can see the arguments
stacking up on either side,'' said Kevin Gaffney, a trader at ABN
Amro Hoare Govett. The doubts left all nine of Europe's major stock
markets lower. (See story: NI EUROWRAP)
