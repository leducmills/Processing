	   Detroit, May 29 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. won't reach
its goal of boosting its U.S. market share to 33 percent in 1997
because of strikes that have crippled production, Chief Executive
John Smith Jr. said.
	   The automaker's U.S. share will rise above last year's level,
but not by the two percentage point increase it was aiming for,
Smith said.
	   GM earlier this month said local strikes this year had cost it
$225 million in earnings. GM over the weekend settled a 50-day
strike at its Oklahoma City plant, which makes Chevrolet Malibu and
Oldsmobile Cutlass cars.
	   A strike continues at a pickup-truck assembly plant in Pontiac,
Michigan.
