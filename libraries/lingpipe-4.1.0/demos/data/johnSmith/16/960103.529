	   Detroit, Jan. 3 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s chairman
and chief executive, John Smith, said the automaker hopes to boost
sales of its new vehicles outside the U.S. to 50 percent by 2002
from 30 percent now.
	   ``I think the 50 percent number is a comfortable target,'' he
said at a briefing at the North American International Auto Show in
Detroit.
	   Much of the growth will come in Asia, where the world's largest
automaker plans to more than double its market share to 10 percent
from 4.6 percent by 2005, he said. GM sold 12 million cars and
trucks in Asia last year.
	   Outside of Japan, the hottest areas for growth in Asia are
China, Indonesia and India, he said.
	   In the U.S., Smith said lower interest rates will lead to higher
sales this year. The automaker predicts that total sales in the
U.S. will be 15.3 million, up from 15.1 million in 1995.
	   Even so, the rising cost of new vehicles -- now averaging more
than $20,000 each -- may hinder sales growth, Smith said.
	   ``Price is a huge issue in the marketplace,'' he said.
	   GM's No. 1 goal for 1996 is to push new products, including four
mid-size models unveiled today, he said. The company also plans to
introduce a minivan later this year and the Cadillac Catera, a
lower-priced luxury car.
	   ``We are biting off a lot; I can't underestimate that,'' Smith
said.
	   Shares of GM fell 3/8 to 51 7/8 today.
	   The new products come as the automaker tries to revamp its
marketing strategies to avoid competition among its seven divisions
and to attract different types of car buyers, including younger
people.
	   The 1997 Oldsmobile Intrigue, Pontiac Grand Prix, Chevrolet
Malibu and Buick Century are aimed at specific groups of buyers,
including those seeking value or luxury, GM executives said at the
auto show.
	   While sales of mid-size cars have slowed in recent years, GM
said it is committed to the market. ``The mid-sized car segment is
still where the largest volume is,'' said G. Richard Wagoner,
president of GM's North American Operations.
	   In the first 11 months of 1995, GM sold 30 percent of the 2.5
million mid-size cars bought in the U.S. That's more than the 23
percent sold by Ford Motor Co. and the 13.7 percent sold by
Chrysler Corp.
	   One concern of analysts is the cost of preparing factories to
build so many new models in one year. Changes often cause expensive
delays to re-tool plants. Re-tooling hampered production and drove
up the cost of the redesigned Chevrolet Cavalier two years ago.
	   ``We learned from the past,'' Wagoner said.
	   The new models are a sign of Ronald Zarrella's influence at GM.
Zarrella, group vice president in charge of sales, service and
marketing, was hired away from Bausch & Lomb Inc. more than a year
ago to revamp GM's marketing.
	   Zarrella said the company developed the four models based on
extensive customer interviews and research.
	   ``We have done our homework,'' he said.
	   Part of GM's new sales efforts may include the no-haggle system
pioneered by its Saturn division, Smith said. ``People like that
system,'' he said.
	   Another switch by GM in the past year is less emphasis on market
share. That's affected sales to rental car companies, an action
often taken by automakers to boost share at the expense of profits.
GM cut its sales to those companies by half to 400,000 since 1991,
the chief executive said.
	   ``Our judgment was it was bad business, and we're better off
without it,'' he said.
	   GM also remains committed to its 50 percent stake in Saab
Automobile AB, a Swedish automaker which has spent the past year
cutting costs, Smith said.
	   ``What it boils down to now for them is that they have to sell
more cars,'' he said.
