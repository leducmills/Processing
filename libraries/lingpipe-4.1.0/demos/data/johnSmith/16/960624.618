	   Stockholm, June 24 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. said it
will pump more money into Saab Automobile AB and could obtain full
ownership of the struggling Swedish automaker within three years.
	   GM and Saab co-owner Investor AB each will inject $262 million,
or a total of $524 million, in loans into Saab through 1997. In
addition, GM will receive an option to buy some or all of
Investor's 50 percent stake in Saab in 1999 or 2000.
	   The move continues GM's recent efforts to make its Saab
investment pay off by taking greater control of the automaker. GM
is hoping it can do with Saab what Ford Motor Co. has done with the
once-ailing Jaguar Plc, but Saab's success is far from assured,
analysts say.
	   ``Saab has proven to be something of a black hole for cash for
GM,'' said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. ``At some point
they have to decide to fish or cut bait.''
	   GM is betting that new models and a pumped-up marketing budget
will boost worldwide sales enough to make Saab more than the
regional automaker it is today. Saab's two models have only 0.2
percent `H,K!UM%QM1IMQ5I-QWorldwide sales last year were $3.01
billion.
	   GM shares fell 1/2 to 5 Saab Chairman Louis Hughes vesprofitable
as early as 1998 if the company is able to boost annual sales
closer to 150,000 from last year's 98,700. Saab must introduce more
models and enhance its marketing operations in the key markets of
Germany, Japan and the U.S., Hughes said in an interview.
	   ``We've got the company back to a break-even point, and now it
needs to grow,'' said Hughes, who also is president of GM's
international operations.
	   Some analysts are skeptical, however. Saab's future ``is really
difficult to forecast right now,'' said Gunnar Andersson, analyst
at Handelsbanken. ``Everything hinges on the success of the new
models.''
	   GM has pumped $1.1 billion into Saab, not including the loans
announced today, since the Detroit-based automaker acquired its 50
percent stake for $600 million in 1990. Saab has turned an annual
profit only twice since then.
	   The investment is ``absolutely worth it,'' Hughes said.
	   GM's new assertiveness includes the naming on June 10 of
U.S.-based GM executive Robert Hendry as Saab's new president and
chief executive. He will replace Butler-Wheelhouse, who is leaving
after four years to become chief executive of UK manufacturer Smith
Industries Plc.
	   Hendry has close ties to GM Chairman and CEO John Smith Jr.
	   Saab also named a former executive of GM's Saturn division, Joel
Manby, as president and chief executive of its U.S. sales and
distribution arm. Saab has been studying the well-regarded sales
and marketing operations of Saturn.
	   To survive in the global auto market, carmakers need a wide
product range and high volumes, industry analysts say. Saab will
use its new funds to try to reach those thresholds.
	   Saab is using GM's massive vehicle development operations to
bring new models out faster and cheaper, analysts said. The new
Saab 900 is based on a GM Opel car, for example.
	   ``Certainly, being associated with GM gives Saab the potential
to sell other models, including a truck or sport utility,'' said
Lincoln Merrihew, a consultant with DRI/McGraw-Hill.
	   Next spring, Saab plans to introduce a third car model to
complement its 900 and 9000 series. Within a few years the
carmaker, known for its luxury, sporty look, will make a station
wagon. Company officials have said a compact car is not out of the
question.
	   To sell the new cars, Saab will double what it usually invests
in marketing. The automaker also said earlier it would invest $1.5
billion in its dealerships worldwide.
	   GM hopes to emulate Ford's success at Jaguar, which Ford bought
for $2.5 billion in 1989. It then invested heavily in the U.K.
company, cut jobs and restructured operations. Jaguar's worldwide
sales rose 32 percent in 1995 to 39,727 after introducing the
restyled sedans that were the fruit of Ford's product development
efforts.
	   Ford doesn't disclose the profits of its divisions, including
Jaguar.
	   In a related move, Ford paid $479.8 million in April to increase
its stake to 33.4 percent from 24.5 percent in Japan's Mazda Motor
Corp. The agreement is expected to help Ford increase its business
in Mazda's Asian markets.
	   In the past, GM has denied that it plans to take full control of
Saab. Hughes said GM is currently satisfied with half ownership of
Saab. The option agreement allows both companies to review the
issue in three years, he said.
	   ``Basically, we wanted to set a time frame for deciding'' both
companies' positions, he said.
	   ``It seems like this (agreement) allows GM maximum
flexibility,'' said Scott Merlis, an independent auto industry
analyst.
	   Under the agreement, Investor has the right to sell up to half
its Saab shares to GM in 2000 if GM hasn't already exercised its
option and bought that many.
	   The arrangement also calls for GM to convert a $172 million loan
to Saab to equity and for Investor to make a $125 million payment
to GM. Investor also will buy a former Saab manufacturing plant in
Malmo, Switzerland, for $35 million.
	   Investor is the holding company for the Wallenberg family of
Sweden, which has controlled Saab since its founding 59 years ago.
GM sought the option to buy Investor's stake, an Investor spokesman
said.
	   ``We didn't want the option that GM could buy all the shares,''
said spokesman Nils-Ingmar Lundin. ``We would have preferred to
keep something, but that's the name of the game,'' in arrangements
like this.
	   GM and Stockholm-based Investor refused to discuss what it would
cost to exercise the options. Investor had booked the value of its
stake in Saab Auto as of March 31 at $446 million.
	   Saab made mainly aircraft until 1949, when it also began
manufacturing cars. Saab AB was merged with truckmaker Scania in
1969, to form Saab-Scania AB. Saab Automobile AB didn't become a
separate entity until 1990, when GM bought its half of the company.
	   In Stockholm, Investor shares rose 6 kronor to 247.
