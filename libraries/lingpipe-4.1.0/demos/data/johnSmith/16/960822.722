
	   DETROIT , The United Automobile Workers union abruptly postponed
plans Thursday to select a Big Three automaker as the first to face
the latest round of labor negotiations, as the union's president
demanded meetings with the chief executives of the carmakers.
	   Stephen Yokich, the UAW's president, said he had decided to
delay a decision on focusing the contract talks solely on one
automaker, because preliminary negotiations at all three
manufacturers have been going well and he did not want to interrupt
them now.
	   The union has traditionally negotiated an agreement first with
the automaker least able to resist its demands, and then has
insisted that the other two automakers accept the same terms.
	   People close to the talks said that another consideration for
Yokich had been a concern that none of the automakers had given a
clear enough presentation on how good a deal might be offered if
the company were picked to go first.
	   ``I think there clearly will be a target,'' said one person with
knowledge of the talks. Several of the 500 union delegates at a
convention in Detroit on Thursday said that Yokich had told them
that he hoped to notify them of his choice on Sunday or Monday.
	   At a news conference Thursday morning, Yokich seemed to relish
the chance to put the pressure on the automakers by keeping them
guessing.
	   He declined to say when he would target a single company, and
even raised the possibility that he would try to negotiate
simultaneous deals with all three automakers , an unlikely prospect
given the fact that the existing labor agreement expires Sept. 14.
	   Within hours of Yokich's request, Robert Eaton, the chairman and
chief executive of Chrysler Corp., and Alexander Trotman, his
counterpart at Ford Motor Co., each met with Yokich. Union
officials also tried to organize a session with John Smith Jr., the
chairman and chief executive of General Motors Corp., but GM
officials declined to say whether a meeting had taken place.
	   Yokich hinted that a pattern agreement this year might be
limited to wages and benefits, leaving each company free to
negotiate its own deal on the most emotional and complicated of
issues , the extent to which the auto companies can buy parts from
low-cost independent suppliers that often are not unionized.
	   The UAW's three-year agreements with GM, Ford and Chrysler all
expire in three weeks. With a few small differences, the agreements
set common wages and benefits for workers, who earn nearly $20 an
hour. The agreements have more differences in other categories,
like outside purchases.
	   Yokich still has plenty of time in which to maneuver, experts in
automotive labor negotiations said. Yokich in fact already broke
with tradition when he said in June that he named Aug. 22 as the
day when he would declare which company would be his primary
bargaining target. Previously the union had announced its choice
with little warning just before or after Labor Day.
	   One thing Yokich emphasized Thursday was his strong desire to
avoid a strike.
	   ``We're not picking a company to strike, we're picking a company
that we can reach an agreement with, to take back to our
membership,'' he said. ``Our membership didn't elect us to go out
there and strike. Our membership elected us to go out there and get
an agreement and bring it back to them, and they'll make the final
approval.''
	   Yokich said that the union's bargaining strategy would not be
governed by the upcoming presidential elections. But labor experts
said that the union was strongly committed to securing President
Clinton's re-election and reluctant to imperil it by staging a
strike this autumn that might make the president look powerless and
remind voters of the labor turbulence of the 1970s.
	   The betting last spring was that Chrysler was the most likely
target because it is the industry's most profitable company. But
this summer, people close to the UAW said the union was leaning
toward confronting GM first.
	   The advantage of going to GM first, UAW officials and others
said, lies in tackling the thornier issues at that company
directly, rather than seeking a deal at Chrysler or Ford that may
be difficult to tailor to GM's problems.
	   The advantage of talking with Chrysler first is that the
automaker is believed anxious for an agreement that would let it
maintain uninterrupted production of its extraordinarily profitable
and popular minivans and Jeeps.
	   The argument for Ford is that the No. 2 automaker has a
tradition of drafting innovative solutions to seemingly intractable
problems. But Ford was the target in the last bargaining round in
1993.
	   Historically the company chosen as the focus of negotiations
gains two big advantages over its rivals.
	   It can try to fashion a deal best suited to its own needs and
then let the union try to force the same deal on its rivals. And
the lead company considerably reduces the risk of a confrontation
this autumn with the much more militant Canadian Automobile
Workers, which selects as its target a different automaker from the
UAW's.
	   In Toronto, Basil (Buzz) Hargrove, president of the Canadian
union, said Thursday he would choose a target for negotiations on
Wednesday. If the UAW's leaders have not made their selection by
then, Hargrove said, he would seek assurances that they would not
choose the same automaker and thus distract that company's
attention from negotiations in Canada.
	   The Canadian union, which broke away from the UAW a decade ago,
has been preparing for a strike this autumn to force its demands
that the automakers, particularly GM, commit themselves not to move
any more work to outside suppliers.
	   Labor officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
that Yokich had been in doubt about which automaker to select for
the talks and then surprised the UAW staff with Thursday's
announcement.
	   Yokich held a dinner party at his house in the Detroit suburb of
St. Clair Shores, Mich., on Wednesday night for the 18 members of
the UAW's board and their spouses, but did not try to decide the
issue at the party, they said.
	   By demanding meetings with the Big Three's chief executives,
Yokich effectively sidestepped the company negotiators handling the
talks until now.
	   Richard Shoemaker, the UAW vice president in charge of relations
with GM, said that he had not spoken directly with Smith or with
Harry Pearce, GM's vice chairman, or J.T. Battenberg III, the head
of GM's auto-parts operations, though Shoemaker added that this was
not unusual.
