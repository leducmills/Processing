
	   DETROIT , General Motors executives said Wednesday that they
expected to reverse the long decline in the company's share of the
American market while expanding GM's highly profitable overseas
operations.
	   Crippled by strikes and plagued by slow introductions of new
models, GM has lost sales in the United States over the last year
even faster than it had been in recent years; the company's
American market share has been shrinking steadily since the early
1960s.
	   GM officials encouraged financial analysts last month to reduce
their estimates of the company's fourth-quarter earnings, while the
company's stock has underperformed the market as investors have
become impatient.
	   But after months of public silence, several top GM officials
said in interviews that the company's long-awaited turnaround in
the United States was at hand. The company's market share will
bounce back as labor peace returns and new models begin coming out
of factories at full speed, they said.
	   The executives also predicted eventual gains in market share and
profits in overseas markets, where GM, the world's largest
automaker, is directing a rising share of its investment budget.
	   John Smith Jr., the chairman, chief executive and president of
GM, said that foreign markets would account for more than half of
GM's auto sales early in the next century, up from 35 percent now.
Harry Pearce, the company's vice chairman, said on Tuesday that GM
wanted to be seen as a global company rather than an American
company.
	   G. Richard Wagoner Jr., the president of GM's North American
operations, predicted Wednesday that the company's share of the
U.S. market, which has dropped to 30 percent this winter from
nearly 34 percent a year ago, would rebound in the latter half of
this year. The company expects its share to stabilize at 33
percent, he said, possibly by the end of this year.
	   J. Michael Losh, GM's chief financial officer, seemed to hint
Tuesday at the possibility of a dividend increase. Asked whether
the company could afford to raise dividends, he said that the
decision would rest with the board later this month, but he noted
that the company during the third quarter had exceeded its goal of
holding $13 billion in cash reserves. He also said that cash
reserves had increased further since then.
	   And Louis Hughes, the president of GM's international
operations, said that while further progress was needed, a
combination of steps taken by company executives had allowed the
company to bounce back from its ``very serious financial
difficulties'' four years ago.
	   ``We've restored the financial health of the company, we have
completely renovated our product line and that is coming to
market,'' Hughes said.
	   GM's 15 new car and mini-van models are reaching the market
slowly. But the company says that is because it is trying to keep
quality high, and some other auto executives have greeted the new
designs with respect.
	   ``They're well-styled, well-executed cars,'' said Robert Lutz,
the vice chairman of Chrysler Corp.
	   But Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Bear Stearns & Co.,
said that it would be hard for GM to win back a large share of the
American market because other companies may cut prices and offer
larger rebates so as to hold on to their recent gains. Each
percentage point of the market is equal to about $2.7 billion in
sales.
	   GM should be able to regain some of its lost market share simply
by maintaining labor peace. Two strikes last year prevented GM from
building 300,000 cars and trucks, which would have been equal to 2
percentage points of the market, Wagoner said.
	   About one-third of the lost production consisted of trucks that
GM is selling as fast as it can build them. The other production
losses were cars, some of which have been in demand and some of
which have not.
	   Wagoner nonetheless warned that the recovery of the company's
North American operations could be hurt by the dollar's recent rise
against the Japanese yen. The dollar's rise has helped Japanese
companies cut prices or hold them level on cars and trucks imported
from Japan or assembled in the United States from parts that are
often imported.
	   Based on economic fundamentals, the dollar should be trading at
85 or 95 yen, Wagoner said. In late afternoon trading Wednesday in
New York, the dollar stood at 115.76 yen.
