	   Detroit, Dec. 18 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. completed
the $9.5 billion spinoff of its Hughes defense business to Raytheon
Co., creating the world's third-biggest company in the
consolidating aerospace and defense industry.
	   The Hughes unit was spun off to GM shareholders, then merged
with Raytheon. GM also merged Hughes' Delco Electronics auto parts
business with its Delphi Automotive Systems unit. That gives
Delphi, already the world's largest auto parts maker, annual
revenue of $30 billion, up from $26 billion.
	   With the transaction, Raytheon's defense sales will total more
than $20 billion and move it to No. 3 from No. 4 among defense
companies, behind No. 1 Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. The
merger allows Raytheon ``to remain a top-tier company'' in the
industry, Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Picard said in a
statement.
	   Raytheon named William Swanson chairman and Ken Dahlberg
president of the combined defense unit, which will be called
Raytheon Systems. Swanson was a Raytheon executive and Dahlberg was
a Hughes vice president.
	   Approval of the plan was expected. GM said 80 percent of the
holders of its Class H shares tendered votes, with 72 percent in
favor. GM and Raytheon common shareholders also approved the
proposal.
	   Under terms of the transaction announced in January, GM
shareholders get 30 percent of the outstanding common stock of the
new Raytheon in Class A shares, worth about $5.6 billion. Raytheon
shareholders get about 70 percent of Raytheon stock, in Class B
shares.
	   Holders of GM common stock get Raytheon shares worth about $3.59
for each GM share. Holders of Class H shares, which tracks Hughes
earnings, receive Raytheon stock worth about $31.64 per Class H
share.
	   Class H shareholders also exchanged their old shares for new
Hughes stock on a one-for-one basis. The new stock tracks the
earnings of the remaining Hughes telecommunications and satellite
business. The company makes commercial communications and DirecTV
home television satellites.
	   The Hughes telecommunications business got a payment of about
$4.0 billion from Raytheon as part of the transaction.
	   GM Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. called the
spinoff ``a win-win for GM and its stockholders.''
	   Not everyone agreed. A group of Class H shareholders seeking to
halt the transaction have filed a class-action lawsuit in Delaware
Chancery Court. The suit hasn't been resolved, though a judge
denied the plaintiffs' request for an injunction to delay the
spinoff.
	   GM said earlier it would book an after-tax gain of $4 billion to
$5 billion in the fourth quarter related to the spinoff. Raytheon
said it would record a fourth-quarter restructuring charge, but
didn't say how much. GM said total fees and charges for the
transaction were $100 million.
	   GM shares were unchanged at 64 3/8 in midday trading. The new GM
Class H shares, which began trading today, rose 2 3/32 to 37 7/8.
	   Raytheon Class B shares rose 1/2 to 56 3/4. Raytheon Class A
shares traded at 55 9/16.
