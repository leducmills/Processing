LEAD STORIES U.S. Economy: Factories Report Mixed Demand in April
By Vincent Del Giudice
	   Washington: U.S. factories reported mixed demand for their
products in April, further evidence the economy is growing at a
subdued pace. ``The underlying growth is still very modest for
manufacturing,'' said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM
MoneyWatch in New York. Total orders for big-ticket goods fell 1.9
percent in April -- the third loss in four months -- as demand
weakened for aircraft, communications gear, and defense hardware.
Orders rose for autos, industrial equipment and primary metals, the
Commerce Department said. When transportation equipment is
excluded, durable goods orders rose 1.7 percent in April, while
non-defense capital goods orders outside aircraft fell 2.8 percent
last month. Published 14:53 (See story: NI ECO)
Friday's U.S. Markets: Dollar, Bonds Rise as Stocks are Mixed By
Michael Smith
	   New York: The dollar rose to its highest level in a month
against the yen after a top Japanese finance ministry official
suggested the U.S. currency could rally by 20 percent. Bonds gained
and stocks were little changed. The dollar rose as high as 107.98
yen in New York trading, its highest level since April 18 after the
official, Eisuke Sakakibara, said the dollar could reach 130 yen.
Sakakibara, the Ministry's international finance unit chief, is
credited with bringing the yen down from a post-World War II peak
last year. ``He's the guy they call `Mr. Yen,''' said David Ogg,
who oversees foreign exchange at HSBC Midland Bank. U.S. bonds
gained as the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose about 1/4, or
$2.50 per $1,000 bond, driving its yield down 3 basis points to
6.83 percent. U.S. stocks were mixed in light trading. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average gained 0.74 to 5762.86, the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index was up 2.50 to 678.50 and the Nasdaq Composite
Index drifted down from yesterday's high, falling 0.84 to 1247.81.
Abbott Labs to Pay $32.5 Mln to 17 States For Price-Fixing Suit By
Marc Monseau
	   Abbott Park, Illinois: Abbott Laboratories, maker of Similac
infant formula, said it will pay $32.5 million in cash and products
to settle baby-formula price-fixing cases brought by 17 states.
Abbott and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Mead Johnson unit, the
nation's two largest makers of infant formula, were the targets of
a suit brought by the states charging them with price fixing. The
actions were filed on behalf of consumers on the basis that
infant-formula prices rose 130 percent between 1980 and 1993 even
as the price of milk dropped by 6 percent. ``This is not an
admission of guilt, it is a settlement,'' said Abbott spokesman
Rick Moser. Abbott said it will pay $25 million in cash and $7.5
million in products. Published 15:32 (See story: NI DRG)
ALSO IN THE NEWS Meriwether's Long Term Capital on Track for Third
Whopping Year By Ken Kohn and Katherine Burton
	   New York: Bond trader John Meriwether and colleagues at Long
Term Capital Management earned investors 20 percent on their money
in the first four months of 1996, maintaining a pace that's reaped
rich returns in its three years. Meriwether, 48, and his partners
in the Greenwich, Connecticut, trading firm collected more than
$300 million in fees last year and generated a 43 percent return
for investors. Meriwether, a former vice chairman and trading chief
at Salomon Brothers Inc., already was held in awe by Wall Street
traders for his skills at fixed-income arbitrage -- big bets on
price discrepancies between bonds in different countries and
currencies. ``I don't know of any better,'' said Michael Holland,
an independent money manager. Published 15:00 (See story: NI SCR)
GM Chief Sees Overseas Sales Rising 50% in 10 Years By Brian
Lysaght
	   Wilmington, Delaware: General Motors Corp. expects sales outside
North America to increase 50 percent in 10 years to 4.5 million
vehicles, Chairman John Smith Jr. said at the annual meeting. Smith
also said the world's biggest automaker wants to mend relations
with the United Auto Workers, which has resisted GM's plans to cut
costs by moving work to outside suppliers. ``Their strategy will be
continued cost-reduction in the U.S. while growing the business
overseas,'' said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. GM is
planning new plants for China, Poland and Southeast Asia. as part
of its largest international expansion. In addition to Asia and the
Pacific, where Smith envisions industry sales climbing 40 percent
in 10 years, the executive expects European sales to rise by 30
percent, mostly in central Europe, and Latin American sales to
increase by 25 percent. Published 15:47 (See story: NI AUT)
Small Business Spotlight: Skin Sites Can Barely Wait for Games By
Adam Levy and Carrick Mollenkamp
	   Dawsonville, Georgia: Hidden Valley Resort, Georgia's largest
nudist camp, is dressing up for the Olympics. The 110-acre retreat,
where dining, dancing, volleyball and shuffleboard are conducted in
the buff, has spent $100,000 or so on its pool area, clubhouse and
gift shop, as well as adding staff and paving roads. ``The Olympics
are going to be the biggest thing that happened to us since
sun-screen,'' said Anita Ohlwiler, owner of the resort, an hour's
drive north of Atlanta in Georgia's mountains. Hidden Valley's
Olympic investment may pale against the hundreds of millions spent
by McDonald's Corp. or Coca-Cola Co. but it represents a big bet on
the part of small businesses awaiting an expected influx of
Europeans. ``They're much more attuned to the nudist lifestyle,''
said Evan Bell, of Bell Acres Recreation Enterprise, or BARE, a
nudist resort in Maysville, Georgia. Strip-tease clubs are spending
more hoping to lure visitors. The Gold Club has a glossy ``Going
for the Gold'' calendar and plans to drape international flags
around the building. ``The place is going to become an Olympic
village,'' said Ed Levin, promotional director of Gold Club.

ECONOMY AND MARKETS Mutual Funds: Will Fidelity Close $55 Billion
Magellan Fund? By Tim Quinson
	   Boston: Will Fidelity Investments' next move be to close its
flagship Magellan Fund to new investors? Analysts and financial
advisers who track the nation's No. 1 fund group say Magellan has
simply gotten too unwieldy for any fund manager to direct
effectively. ``Fidelity should close Magellan,'' said Stephen
Janachowski, a financial adviser in San Francisco. ``I'd rather
invest in an index fund than Magellan. It's simply gotten too big
to be managed as effectively as it was in the past.'' Fidelity
yesterday named Bob Stansky to manage the $55 billion Magellan Fund
as the successor to Jeffrey N. Vinik, 37, who quit after almost
four years of running the fund to open his own money management
firm. Shutting Magellan to new investors also has drawbacks. The
fund generates estimated annual revenue of about $500 million from
management and other fees. Fidelity had almost $4.28 billion in
total revenue in 1995. Published 15:04 (See story: NI FND)
Japan's Banks Say Bad Loans Wiped Out Record Earnings By Todd Zaun
and Mayumi Otsuma
	   Tokyo: Most of Japan's largest commercial banks reported their
first net losses in five decades for 1995, taking write-offs of
trillions of yen for bad loans that wiped out record operating
profits. The banks projected that profits will plunge 34 percent
this year to 2.305 trillion yen ($21.35 billion) as interest rates
rise. That will jeopardize their efforts to jettison the bad loans
still spoiling their balance sheets. ``Last fiscal year was
absolutely heaven for the banks,'' said Walter Altherr of Jardine
Fleming Securities Ltd. ``But if interest rates continue to rise,
they won't be able to maintain those levels'' of operating profits.
Added Yukiko Ohara of UBS Securities. ``It will take three or four
more years for banks to solve their bad-loan problems.'' Published
