
	   LOS ANGELES , From a high-tech satellite factory to a power
lunch in Beverly Hills, Chinese President Jiang Zemin cheerfully
promoted trans-Pacific commerce in California on Sunday, despite
some noisy protests and a pointed warning from his host, Gov. Pete
Wilson, that ``the great elixir of individual freedom'' is the best
recipe for economic growth.
	   As Jiang wound up his weeklong visit to the United States with a
stop in a state that accounts for more than a quarter of all
American exports to China, he sat in the passenger seat of a Buick
Regal , the type that is to be built in China starting next year ,
and then met privately with the governor before gently pleading
with business and political leaders for patience in resolving
differences and improving ties.
	   ``As the old Chinese saying goes, a 10,000-mile journey begins
with the first step,'' Jiang told an audience of some 700 people
that included former Secretary of State Warren Christopher; Peter
O'Malley, the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers; Rupert Murdoch (who
is in the process of buying the Dodgers) and other corporate
chieftains; and Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles.
	   A similar number of protesters gathered outside the Beverly
Hilton, burning Chinese flags and waving placards with slogans like
``Communism Kills,'' ``Give Jiang a Heart,'' and ``China Most
Favored Oppressor.'' The demonstrators drew honks of support from
passing motorists.
	   Wilson, who visited China on a trade mission last winter,
invoked the memory of the Chinese laborers who toiled on
California's railroads to welcome Jiang to ``the state built with
Chinese muscle in the 19th century and with Chinese genius in the
high-tech world of the 20th century.'' But in introducing Jiang at
the lunch, the Republican governor also referred indirectly to
China's human rights record as Jiang sat stone-faced on the dais.
	   ``A free people deserves to be, and inevitably will be, more
creative and productive in every way than those who labor in
servitude with no hope of sharing the fruits of their labor,''
Wilson said. ``The great elixir of individual freedom is the best
prescription to accelerate and intensify your success.''
	   But the overall theme of the day was economic cooperation ,
hardly surprising since California now exports goods worth about $6
billion a year to China, mostly in computer and aerospace
equipment, and China is now the state's sixth-largest trading
partner, just behind Taiwan. Unlike politicians along the eastern
seaboard, many of whom shunned Jiang, California officials cannot
ignore the commercial impact of China on their state.
	   ``The whole West Coast is more aware of what a huge part of the
economy it is, I think,'' said one of Jiang's lunchtime listeners,
Mayor Beverly O'Neill of nearby Long Beach, which is trying to
expand the presence of Chinese shipping in its port. ``He's getting
a reception that shows that we would like to talk.''
	   O'Malley, who built a baseball field for a school in Tianjin,
near Beijing, a decade ago, has sponsored coaching and sports
medicine exchanges between Chinese baseball clubs and their
counterparts on the Dodgers. He ultimately hopes to build a
baseball academy in China, where baseball is just beginning to
become popular.
	   ``Sports can do so much,'' O'Malley said. ``Baseball can bring
people together. My dream is to someday see a Dodger from the
People's Republic.''
	   For his part, Wilson said he favored a ``two track'' approach of
registering protests and disapproval of Chinese abuses, while
seeking better ties. ``I think that if you fail to meet with
people, it is very hard to communicate,'' he said.
	   The Chinese are feuding with Hollywood these days over several
movies , including Walt Disney Co.'s coming ``Kundun,'' about the
Dalai Lama, that portray China in a less than flattering light ,
and Jiang passed up the chance for souvenir photo opportunities at
Southern California meccas like Disneyland or the Mann's Chinese
Theater.
	   Instead, first thing Sunday morning, the former electrical
engineer headed for the headquarters of Hughes Electronics Corp.
near Los Angeles International Airport and later to its
manufacturing plant.
	   At Hughes, Jiang celebrated the communications satellite
equipment that the company is selling to China and the automobiles
that its parent company, General Motors, plans to build there.
Company officials showed off a new service using satellite
technology in which motorists who lock their keys in the car can
telephone a central operator and have the doors unlocked.
	   Jiang was also treated to a bit of joking about that most common
of American names, since the chairman of Hughes and the chairman of
General Motors happen to be brothers , Michael T. and John F. Smith
Jr.
	   ``Now I know you are brothers because your face is very
similar,'' Jiang told John Smith after accepting a model of a
HS-702 satellite to be launched next year. ``Only you are a little
bit taller.''
