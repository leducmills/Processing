	   Washington, Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- President Bill Clinton will
meet with the chief executives of Ford Motor Co., General Motors
Corp. and Chrysler Corp. at the White House tomorrow, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said today.
	   The president wants to talk to them about U.S.-Japan trade
agreements, fuel efficiency, the environment and the economy,
McCurry said. Clinton will also discuss his administration's
efforts to get Congress to renew a special negotiating authority,
known as fast track, that makes it easier to negotiate trade
agreements, he said.
	   ``They will discuss a range of issues from trade and the opening
of markets for U.S. vehicles to the state of the economy,'' said
McCurry, adding that the meeting was not set up to coincide with
the release of a Super 301 report expected this week in which South
Korea and Japan will likely come under fire for their restrictive
trade barriers against foreign autos.
	   Even so, while the Super 301 report isn't specifically on the
agenda, U.S. automakers' concerns about South Korea's violation of
key provisions of a 1995 accord aimed at opening its markets to
U.S. vehicles and their continued beefs with Japan over market
access are likely to come up.
	   Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers
Association which represents the big three U.S. automakers, charged
last week that Korea has failed to discourage bureaucrats from
taking measures that hobble foreign car sales.
	   One major U.S. concern is Korea's failure to stop threatening
tax audits on consumers who buy foreign cars, adding to the
perception that Korean consumer shouldn't buy imported vehicles.
	   The auto parts market in Japan is another bone of contention.
U.S. Trade Rep. Charlene Barshefsky and Commerce Secretary William
Daley have told Japanese officials that the pace and scope of
Japanese deregulation in its auto parts market has been too slow.
	   The two sent a letter to the Japanese Transport Ministry in
August saying Japan hasn't opened its markets to the extent called
for under a 1995 bilateral auto agreement. Big Three automakers are
keen to crack the Japanese parts market as well.
	   Clinton last met with Ford chairman and chief executive Alex
Trotman, GM Chairman John Smith and Chrysler's chairman, president
and CEO Robert Eaton in June after a meeting he had with Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The automakers discussed their
concerns about the weak yen and the impact that rising imports of
Japanese cars could have on the economy.
	   Vice President Al Gore met with the auto industry leaders in
Detroit in April.
