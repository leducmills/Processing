	   Detroit, Jan. 27 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. approved a
$2.5 billion share repurchase program and increased the dividend 25
percent on its most widely held stock, but the moves disappointed
some investors who were expecting more.
	   GM raised the quarterly common stock dividend to 50 cents a
share from 40 cents. The automaker said it will buy back about 5
percent of its shares outstanding during the next 12 months and
will consider buying more.
	   The moves had been expected because of GM's expanding cash
reserve. Some investors and analysts had hoped the dividend would
rise to 60 cents and that GM would buy back $3 billion in stock.
	   ``People wanted a more aggressive first step,'' said Credit
Suisse First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas. GM shares fell 5/8 to
61 7/8 today, after dropping as low as 59 3/4.
	   Not all investors were disappointed.
	   ``It's a good move,'' said Jim Walline, vice president of
equities at the Lutheran Brotherhood in Minneapolis, which owns or
manages 754,300 GM shares. ``The company is moving in the right
direction, but it was obviously less than a lot of people had
expected.''
	   The increase puts GM's dividend yield at 3.2 percent, trailing
Chrysler Corp.'s yield of 4.6 percent and Ford Motor Co.'s 4.7
percent. All are well above the 2.0 percent average for the Dow
Jones Industrial Average's 30 blue-chip stocks.
	   GM said today its cash balance grew to $17 billion at the end of
the fourth quarter, up from $10 billion in 1995. Colas said the
cash increased more than expected, making today's actions seem even
more conservative.
	   The caution in today's action may stem from the fact that GM
isn't enjoying the record profit of crosstown rival Chrysler and
that it is spending heavily to introduce 15 new car and truck
models this year.
	   The dividend and buyback plans are designed to return ``capital
to shareholders in a manner which is sustainable throughout the
business cycle,'' Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. said.
	   GM wants to avoid setting the dividend at a level that it
couldn't afford in an auto industry downturn, which happened
earlier this decade.
	   The automaker's dividend hit a high of 75 cents in 1989 and
1990. It was cut to 40 cents in 1991, when GM was struggling amid
an industry recession and reported a loss of $4.45 billion. It was
cut again to 20 cents in late 1992.
	   ``We think investors want a stable dividend,'' GM spokeswoman
Toni Simonetti said.
	   Since those deep cuts, GM has increased its dividend
incrementally. The payment rose to 30 cents from 20 cents in May
1995 and to 40 cents in February 1996.
	   The latest common stock dividend increase is payable March 10 to
holders of record Feb. 6.
	   The dividend and buyback plan were as big as could be expected,
said Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi.
	   ``The problem is that expectations are too high,'' Phillippi
said. He added that another dividend hike could follow later this
year, followed by more stock repurchases next year. GM today also
raised the quarterly dividend on its Class H shares to 25 cents a
share from 24 cents, payable March 10 to shareholders of record
Feb. 6.
	   Class H shares are tied to the earnings of Hughes Electronics
Corp. GMH shares rose 1/8 to 61 3/8.
	   GM will report its fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow morning. The
automaker is expected to post sharply lower profits because several
union strikes cut $700 million in net income.
	   The automaker is expected to report profit from operations of 52
cents a share, down from $1.98 a share a year ago, analysts said.
