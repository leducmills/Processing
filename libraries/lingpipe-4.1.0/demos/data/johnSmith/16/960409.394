	   Detroit, April 9 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. Chairman
and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. received $3.25 million in salary
and bonus in 1995, a decline of 5.1% from a year earlier.
	   Smith received about $3.43 million in salary and bonus in 1994,
the company said in its annual proxy statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   The company said the chairman's bonus, which is based on
profitability goals set for the company, declined 9.1 percent this
year to $1.75 million from $1.93 million. His base salary was
unchanged at $1.5 million.
	   ``Even with the significant performance improvements during 1995
-- net income increased 40 percent -- final results were at a level
below those established by the Executive Compensation committee for
maximum bonus payments,'' the company said.
	   General Motors earned a record $6.9 billion, or $7.21 a share
last year, up from $4.9 billion, or $5.15 a share, in 1994.
	   Smith also was awarded options on 150,000 shares of stock,
compared with 120,000 options a year earlier, and $2.3 million in
long-term incentives to be paid in stock. The final installment on
the long-term incentive plan is due after Smith retires.
	   The executive bonus is based on the achievement of targets for
return on net assets over a three-year period, the company said.
	   Smith's compensation falls below that of Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Robert Eaton's pay package of $7.2 million in 1994. Ford Motor Co.
is releasing details of its executive pay in the company proxy
later today.
