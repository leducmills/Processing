	   Detroit, June 30 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. said union
strikes at two U.S. assembly plants cut its second-quarter net
profit by $490 million, or 67 cents a share, more than twice the
amount it disclosed May 15.
	   The automaker said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission today that the United Auto Workers walkouts at the
Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Michigan, plants reduced output of
Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Cutlass cars and full-size
Chevrolet and GM pickup trucks by 96,000 units.
	   The seven-week strike by 3,500 Oklahoma City workers ended May
27. It came just at the automaker was introducing one of its most
important all-new models, the Malibu sedan.
	   The continuing strike by 5,400 Pontiac workers began April 22
has become the longest and most costly of five walkouts against the
automaker this year.
	   Big pickups are GM's best-selling vehicles and among its most
profitable. While three other North American plants make the
trucks, the Pontiac plant builds most of the extended-cab models,
which are among the most popular.
	   The company can hold out longer, analysts said, although the
pretax profit on each pickup truck is about $9,000 -- more than it
earns from Malibu and other cars.
	   ``GM can afford to take this one for a while,'' said David
Healy, a Burnham Securities analyst. He said the per-share strike
cost was about 7 cents higher than he had estimated.
	   Negotiators met again today to try to resolve the Pontiac
dispute, and there were no indications that a settlement is near.
``It's status quo as far as I know,'' a GM spokesman said.
	   The automaker was expected to earn $2.44 a share in the second
quarter, which ends today, based on the average estimate of 10
analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc. GM earned $2.67 a
share in the year-earlier quarter.
	   GM shares fell 1/16 to 55 3/4 today.
	   Analysts have said that more strikes are likely as GM continues
to reduce its hourly workforce through attrition and introduces
cars and trucks that have fewer parts and require fewer workers to
build.
	   ``Investors realize this is going to be a long, slow simmering
feud between the union and the company,'' said Nick Colas, an
analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
	   GM said in an SEC filing May 15 that the strike cut profits by
$225 million. That amount is included in today's total.
	   The company said the lost profits included $375 for its North
American car and truck making business; $85 million for its Delphi
Automotive Systems parts-making unit; and $30 million for its Delco
Electronics unit, which is part of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp.
	   The strikes have had another impact for the automaker. Chairman
and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. said in May that the company
won't regain 2 points of U.S. market share as it had hoped this
year because the strikes have hurt production. GM was aiming to
increase its share to 33 percent from about 31 percent.
