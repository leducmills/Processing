	   Detroit, Aug. 14 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. said it's
begun a product-by-product study that could result in changes to
underperforming businesses.
	   GM said it will review its North American and international
carmaking units, as well as parts unit Delphi Automotive, in an
effort to boost profitability. The internal study is to be finished
around December or January, the company said today in its 10-Q
filling with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   While the automaker routinely reviews its operations, this study
will be more detailed. Each product line's profitability will be
reviewed, said Jim Finn, a company spokesman.
	   ``It's going a little deeper this time,'' said Finn, who
wouldn't discuss what actions GM might take after the report is
completed. He did say GM would consider recording a one-time charge
against earnings to reflect unprofitable businesses.
	   Delphi has reviewed the profits of each of its auto-parts plants
and sold or closed several that were unprofitable. Others have been
brought back to profitability.
	   The company's international carmaking business will review its
operations in light of continued excess capacity in Europe, the SEC
filing said.
	   In North America, GM has been struggling with a sinking market
share and inefficient plants.
	   Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith has set a goal of
boosting the company's net profit margin -- the amount of profit
earned on each sales dollar -- to 5 percent through good times and
bad. The net margin hit 5.0 percent over the first six months of
1997, up from 3.9 percent in the year-earlier period.
	   GM shares fell 1/16 to 60 15/16.
