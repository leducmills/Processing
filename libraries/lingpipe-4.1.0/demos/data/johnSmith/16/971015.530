	   Washington, Oct. 15 (Bloomberg) -- General Motor Corp.'s
divestment of its Hughes Electronics defense business may provide a
$236-million boost to the profit sharing-plan for hourly GM
employees.
	   Hughes has agreed to spin off shares in the defense business to
GM common and Class H shareholders and then combine the stand-alone
unit with Raytheon Co. The $4.4 billion gain that GM expects to
record on the transaction would increase pre-tax income, the
primary determinant of the annual profit-sharing award.
	   GM officials cautioned that the potential Hughes gain is just
one of many factors that affect pretax income for 1997. GM
spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said the other factors could offset the
gain, disclosed in a recent company filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
	   In a broader sense, the Hughes profit sharing presents an
interesting quandary for the United Auto Workers union, according
to Jim Hall at AutoPacific Inc., of Santa Ana, California. While
the UAW has sought to keep jobs at GM, its rank-and-file members
may profit from a sale that reduces the company's overall
workforce, Hall said.
	   ``Here is a windfall that comes from the dissolution and sale of
a unit within GM,'' said Hall, an analyst at the automotive
marketing and product consulting firm. ``It raises questions for
the union when it comes time to bargain.''
	   Workers at GM's Canadian operations went on strike last year to
win a labor contract that stemmed the loss of union jobs to outside
suppliers. GM, whose chairman is John Smith, announced that labor
strikes in the U.S. and Canada during 1996 cost the company some
$1.1 billion in pretax profits.
	   Officials at the UAW had no immediate comment on the Hughes
transaction and the profit-sharing payout that could result. The
UAW represents 225,000 GM workers in the U.S., but doesn't
represent any Hughes employees, Simonetti said.
	   Payments under the GM profit-sharing plan for hourly employees
are based on the company's pretax profits in the U.S., including
income from automotive, telecommunications and finance operations.
The formula for calculating the profit sharing is negotiated
between GM and its unions.
	   By itself, the gain on the Hughes transaction could prove a big
bonus to the 282,000 employees who are eligible to participate in
the hourly profit-sharing plan.
	   While strikes reduced the payout GM workers received last year,
the maximum bonus in 1995 totaled $814. Based on simple arithmetic
-- which has little to do with the actual profit-sharing formula --
the $236 million gain from the Hughes transaction alone would equal
about $837 per worker.
	   Simonetti cautioned that this figure may not accurately reflect
the bonus GM workers actually receive. Any number of factors could
drive down total pretax income reported for the calculation of the
profit-sharing payment.
	   ``The gain from the Hughes transaction would be a plus'' for the
profit-sharing plan, Simonetti said today. ``But until we get to
the end of the year, I can't tell you there won't be a minus
somewhere.''
	   Moreover, any gain that employees reap this year from the Hughes
transaction will be offset in later years. That's because the
Hughes defense business will no longer be contributing to U.S.
pretax income, according to the SEC filing.
	   The $236 million figure was included in a description of a
presentation that Salomon Brothers and Merrill Lynch made to GM's
board on Oct. 6. According to the filing, the investment bankers
noted that GM management thought the Hughes transaction may result
in an incremental profit-sharing charge for 1997 of $236 million.
Simonetti confirmed that this represents an estimate of the maximum
that could be added to the profit sharing plan.
	   ``The gain on the Hughes Defense spin-off will not necessarily
result in a payout to plan participants equivalent'' to $236
million ``because numerous other factors may affect GM's pre-tax
income for the entire calendar year,'' the filing said.
