	   (Updates with closing share prices)
	   Detroit, Aug. 4 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. said it will
repurchase $2.5 billion in stock, its second big buyback program in
a year, but disappointed investors by leaving its dividend
unchanged.
	   Some analysts and investors were expecting a bigger buyback or
another dividend boost because the company is almost $2 billion
above its $13 billion target for cash on hand.
	   GM shares fell 1 13/16 to 62 5/8 in trading of 4.38 million
shares, compared with the three-month-daily average of 2.45
million. The decline erased some of the 15 percent gain GM shares
rang up last week.
	   ``I'm not trying to sneeze at $2.5 billion, but it's probably
not enough to move the market for a company of GM's size,'' said
Tom DiBella, vice president of Aeltus Investment Management in
Hartford, Connecticut. The firm recently sold its GM shares and
bought Chrysler Corp. stock, DiBella said.
	   GM said it wanted to maintain its dividend at a level that could
be maintained through an industry slowdown. Some analysts also said
they expect the company to increase its dividend early next year.
	   Still, investors were hoping GM would boost its dividend yield
to match that of its U.S. competitors, analysts said. GM's dividend
yield is 3.2 percent, compared with Chrysler's 4.4 percent and Ford
Motor Co.'s 4.1 percent.
	   ``GM's dividend will be increased sooner or later,'' said
Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. ``Maybe the people looking
for sooner are disappointed.''
	   GM's stock had risen 15 percent in the five days ending Friday,
to 64 7/16. That was its highest level since 64 3/4 on Feb. 8,
1994.
	   The increase reflected expectations of a dividend hike or
buyback, as well as the belief that GM shares have the most to gain
in the next six months among Detroit's automakers, whose shares are
all relatively cheap. Chrysler, Ford and GM sell at an average of
8.38 times earnings, well below the 23.8 average price-earnings
ratio for the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index.
	   Ford shares rose 5/8 to 41 1/4, while Chrysler gained 1/8 to 36
9/16.
	   GM will repurchase the shares over 12 months, reducing its
shares outstanding by 4.6 percent. The company repurchased 43.7
million shares beginning last January in a $2.5 billion buyback
that ended about five months early.
	   The market reacted in similar fashion on Jan. 27, the day the
company announced the first buyback and a 25 percent increase of
its quarterly dividend to 50 cents a share from 40 cents. GM stock
fell 5/8 to 61 7/8 that day and traded as low as 59 3/4.
	   The company today defended its decision not to increase the
dividend. ``Our policy is that the dividend is one that can be
sustained even through a downturn,'' said a spokesman, Jim Finn.
	   GM's dividend was as high as 75 cents in 1989 and 1990. It was
cut to 40 cents in 1991, when the company struggled through an
industry recession and reported a loss of $4.45 billion.
	   Finn said the company is boosting shareholder value with the two
repurchase programs, the dividend increase in this year's first
quarter and the proposed $9.5 billion sale of its Hughes defense
unit to Raytheon Co., which is awaiting government approval.
	   Some analysts said the company won't make another dividend move
until after the Hughes-Raytheon agreement is completed, expected in
the fourth quarter.
	   In addition, the company said it's considering other ways to
return cash to shareholders. ``We expect to consider additional
programs in the future, within the framework of the investment
requirements to maintain and grow the business, the overall
business climate and our cash position growing forward,'' Chairman
and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. said in a statement.
	   He said GM's cash position was strong. The company had $14.9
billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the second
quarter, up from $14.6 billion at the end of the first quarter and
$13.0 billion in the year-earlier second quarter. The increase came
despite the share repurchases and two strikes that cost the company
$490 million in profit.
	   GM has set an informal goal of $13.0 billion for weathering
another industry downturn without reducing its overseas expansion
or new car and truck programs, Finn said.
	   ``The company has basically met its cash goals,'' said Credit
Suisse First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas. A dividend increase is
likely later on, he said.
	   GM has increased its payout in the first or second quarter of
each of the last three years.
