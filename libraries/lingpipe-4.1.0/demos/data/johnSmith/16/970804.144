	   Detroit, Aug. 4 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. said it will
repurchase $2.5 billion in stock, in its second buyback program in
a year.
	   The company said the shares would be bought back over the next
year and would result in a 4.6 percent reduction in its shares
outstanding. The company repurchased 43.7 million shares beginning
last January in a just-ended $2.5 billion buyback.
	   GM's board of directors, meeting today, left the company's
dividend unchanged, though the company said it would reconsider
other ways in the future to return cash to shareholders.
	   ``We expect to consider additional programs in the future,
within the framework of the investment requirements to maintain and
grow the business, the overall business climate and our cash
position growing forward,'' Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith
Jr. said in a statement.
	   GM shares fell 1 3/16 to 63 1/4 in early trading.
	   Speculation about a stock buyback or dividend increase had
helped boost GM shares 15 percent in the last five days.
