	   (Repeats to change phrase in lede to ``most widely held.'')
	   Detroit, Jan. 27 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. approved a
$2.5 billion share repurchase program and increased the dividend 25
percent on its most widely held stock, but the moves disappointed
some investors who were expecting more.
	   GM increased the quarterly dividend on its $1 2/3 common stock
to 50 cents a share from 40 cents, payable March 10 to holders of
record Feb. 6. The automaker said it will rebuy about 5 percent of
its outstanding common shares during the next 12 months and will
consider buying more.
	   Analysts have expected the dividend hike for months, citing GM's
growing cash reserves. Some analysts expected the dividend to rise
to 60 cents and GM to rebuy $3 billion in stock.
	   ``People wanted a more aggressive first step,'' said Credit
Suisse First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas.
	   GM shares fell 2 1/4 to 60 1/4 in midday trading.
	   The moves are designed to return ``capital to shareholders in a
manner which is sustainable throughout the business cycle,''
Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. said.
	   GM's cash balance grew to $17 billion at the end of the fourth
quarter, Smith said, up from $10 billion the year before. Colas
said the cash balance grew more than expected and increased the
expectations for bigger dividend and buyback programs.
	   The automaker also raised the quarterly dividend on its Class H
shares to 25 cents a share from 24 cents, payable March 10 to
shareholders of record Feb. 6.
	   Class H shares are tied to the earnings of Hughes Electronics
Corp. GMH shares rose 1/2 to 61 3/4 in midday trading. --Brian
