	   Rochester, Michigan, July 31 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors
Corp.'s chairman and chief executive said new GM cars and minivans
being introduced this year will help the company regain market
share.
	   The world's largest automaker has seen its U.S. market share
drop to 32 percent through June from 35 percent in 1991, and some
analysts see it declining further.
	   GM wants to boost its market position by introducing
high-quality cars and trucks, John Smith Jr., GM chairman and chief
executive, said. About a quarter of GM's lineup has been redesigned
for the 1997 model year.
	   ``There's room to take share, there's no question in my mind
about that,'' Smith told reporters at a luncheon in Rochester,
Michigan. He declined to give any specific targets.
	   Part of the market share decline stems from GM efforts to reduce
low-profit sales to rental car fleets. Smith said the company wants
to boost its share profitably.
	   ``We're not looking to gain share by giving (cars and trucks)
away,'' he said.
	   GM has been edged out as more nimble domestic competitors take
advantage of growing light truck sales, and as Asian and European
automakers step up U.S. production and sales.
	   GM is in early stages of production of its new Pontiac Grand
Prix, Saturn coupe and restyled Oldsmobile, Pontiac, GMC and
Chevrolet minivans, which will be available for the 1997 model
year.
	   Smith also said the company was making strides to improve its
manufacturing efficiency to match the industry's best. The average
46 hours it takes GM to build a vehicle is North America's highest,
according to a recent study by consultants Harbour and Associates.
	   That means GM's labor costs are higher for every vehicle it
builds. Nissan Motor Co. needs 27.36 labor hours to build each
vehicle, the best rate in North America, the report said.
	   GM plans to match the industry's best productivity levels ``in
the next few years,'' Smith said. ``It's a continuous process and
we're working hard at that,'' he said.
	   GM still hopes to avoid a strike by successfully negotiating a
new contract this fall with the United Auto Workers, Smith said.
Those negotiations have been underway for several weeks.
	   The company last week settled a thorny dispute by reinstating a
union local leader at a Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant who was
fired in April for alleged time-card fraud. The firing of Al Alli
sparked a one-day walkout by members of UAW Local 1112.
	   ``It's something we needed to get behind us,'' Smith said of the
Lordstown matter.
