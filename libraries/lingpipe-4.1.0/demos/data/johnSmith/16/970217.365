
	   DETROIT , Just four years ago, a senior General Motors executive
from Detroit appalled a roomful of diplomats and trade negotiators
at an embassy dinner in Washington by loudly arguing that the
nation's capital did not really matter because it did not
manufacture anything.
	   That attitude, once common at the nation's biggest company, is
now fading quickly. As the automaker builds new factories in
Poland, Thailand and Argentina, and as the rising dollar has helped
propel sales of foreign cars in America, General Motors Corp. is
becoming much more active on public policy issues.
	   The dollar's ascent has underscored GM's change of heart. This
winter, GM executives were among the first to warn about the
bruising effects of the dollar's rise on American manufacturers and
to lead efforts to convince Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that
the dollar is too high in currency markets. A dozen years ago, when
the dollar was also soaring, GM was one of the last big
manufacturers to push for government relief.
	   At the same time, Louis Hughes, the president of GM's
international operations, has become an outspoken critic of plans
for a single European currency, because he fears it could initially
squeeze profits and slow economic growth. The automaker's
Washington office has stepped up its lobbying on issues like global
warming, because of worries that new controls could be placed on
the worldwide auto industry. And GM's board has just added two
directors known for their outspoken but different views on
international trade.
	   Even John Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive and a
businessman who remains visibly uncomfortable discussing public
policy issues, now says that the company will inevitably take more
public positions as it expands overseas. There is ``no doubt that
will happen,'' he said, pointing out that GM strongly favored the
United States' renewal last year of China's most favored nation
status.
	   One reason is that GM is rapidly expanding its operations in
many Asian and Latin American markets where overcoming trade
restrictions and winning government approval for factories are
often crucial for success. So GM has been turning to Washington for
the same support that foreign automakers have long sought from
their home governments.
	   It is impossible for GM to run its worldwide operations
``without assuming some responsibility for being a well-informed
participant in public policy debates and issues,'' said Harry
Pearce, GM's vice chairman.
	   Current and former GM executives cite several other reasons the
automaker is no longer the corporate wallflower on policy issues
that it used to be. One simple reason is that GM has recovered from
its management crisis in the early 1990s, so its executives have
more time to spend on longer-term issues.
	   Another reason is that GM's public policy decision making has
shifted away from the financial staff in New York City, where a
laissez-faire ethos has long been strong. Decisions are
increasingly being made instead in Detroit by Pearce, a lawyer who
made his reputation handling product liability issues in Washington
and in courtrooms around the country.
	   During the mid-1980s, the ambivalence of the New York operations
on dollar policy created tensions within GM. ``Back in those days,
some of the operating people felt we should have been more vocal
than we were,'' Lloyd Reuss, GM's retired president, said.
	   Marina Whitman, the vice president and group executive for
public affairs during much of the 1980s, said that GM had lobbied
the Reagan administration vigorously for a weaker dollar after
Caterpillar Inc. had begun doing so. But she added that, ``We may
have been a little slow , I think with 20-20 hindsight, if I had to
do it all over again, we might have waded in sooner.''
	   The question now is whether GM's next step will be to seek any
restrictions on auto imports. Any such move would break a long
corporate tradition of support for free trade.
	   In the late 1970s, GM declined to participate in an attempt by
Ford Motor Co. to win protection from Japanese imports, effectively
dooming the effort. As recently as February 1993, GM pulled out of
lawsuit preparations by Ford and Chrysler Corp., which wanted
billions of dollars in tariffs imposed on Japanese cars allegedly
being dumped at unfairly low prices in the United States. Because
of GM's action, the lawsuit was never filed.
	   GM has just added two directors with very different views on
trade. One of the new directors, George Fisher, the chairman, chief
executive and president of Eastman Kodak Co., has made repeated use
of unilateral American trade laws in trying to break open the
Japanese market and restrict the sale of supposedly underpriced
Japanese goods in the United States.
	   While cautioning that he was still learning about the auto
industry and had not joined GM's board to be a trade specialist,
Fisher said that he saw some parallels between trade issues facing
Kodak and GM. He contended that the Japanese film market is
sufficiently closed to foreign companies that producers there can
collect high profits and use the money to buy market share
elsewhere.
	   ``A lot of the same arguments apply to the auto business,'' he
said in his first interview after being named to the GM board.
	   Percy Barnevik, chairman and chief executive of ABB Asea Brown
Boveri Ltd., a Zurich-based engineering giant, was also recently
named to the GM board and is outspoken on trade policy, but with a
different emphasis. Having spent his career as a businessman in
Switzerland and Sweden, countries with small markets and little
ability to threaten trade sanctions, he has strongly supported
international limits on unilateral trade laws.
