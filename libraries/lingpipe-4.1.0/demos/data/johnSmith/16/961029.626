	   (Adds details about strike at Janesville, Wisconsin plant.).
	   Indianapolis, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.
workers at plants in Indianapolis and in Janesville, Wisconsin went
on strike tonight as the United Auto Workers increased pressure on
GM to settle contract talks with the union.
	   The walkout by 2,750 Indianapolis stamping-plant workers at 6
p.m. EST was followed an hour later by the departure of 4,800
Janesville workers, who make GM's most profitable vehicles.
	   The UAW is pressuring the automaker to resolve individual
contract issues with some of its 123 union locals. The union and
the company also are negotiating a national agreement covering
220,000 GM workers. Talks between GM and UAW negotiators on the
national contract broke off for the night at 8:30.
	   The union has threatened a series of plant strikes to force an
agreement on local and national talks, observers said.
	   ``We'll see if GM blinks,'' said Sean McAlinden, a labor expert
at the University of Michigan.
	   The strikes could severely damage GM's production of passenger
trucks, which already are in short supply.
	   The Janesville plant makes GM's most profitable vehicles
--full-size Chevrolet and GMC Suburban and Tahoe/Yukon sport
utility vehicles. The plant also makes medium-duty trucks.
	   The Indianapolis metal-fabrication plant supplies body panels
for GM's best-selling full-size pickup trucks and sport utility
vehicles.
	   With local strikes rather than company-wide ones, the union is
trying to inflict damage on the company while not risking a total
shutdown.
	   ``The goal is to use minimum resources for maximum effect,''
said Ken Blaschke, a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst.
	   The Indianapolis walkout could cause a parts shortage and halt
production within days at truck assembly plants in Fort Wayne,
Indiana; and Pontiac, Michigan.
	   The Pontiac and Fort Wayne plants make full-size Chevrolet and
GMC pickup trucks, GM's top sellers.
	   GM spokesmen confirmed the strikes but declined to comment
further. Officials at UAW headquarters in Detroit could not be
reached for comment.
	   The union let a midnight Sunday agreement deadline pass without
calling a nationwide strike. Top negotiators still haven't resolved
conflicts about job security and GM's use of outside contractors.
	   The walkouts came after union and company negotiators at the two
plants failed to reach contract settlements. The problems aren't
isolated. Only a few union locals have reached agreements with GM
on the plant-specific contracts they negotiate with plant managers.
The agreements cover work rules, employment levels and other plant
issues.
	   ``We're just tired of waiting to resolve our local issues,''
said Joe Burkhamer, president of UAW Local 2209 in Fort Wayne. He
said the Indianapolis strike could halt production at the plant
within 72 hours.
	   GM Chairman and CEO John Smith Jr. said in New York today that
GM may be willing to speed up talks with union locals. The
automaker said today that 22,913 U.S. and Mexican workers remain
laid off because of parts shortages caused by a three-week Canadian
Auto Workers strike that ended last week.
