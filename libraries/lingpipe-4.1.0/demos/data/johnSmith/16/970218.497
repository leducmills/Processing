	   Detroit, Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac
division may add a small station wagon or sport utility vehicle to
its luxury car lineup, the division's new general manager said.
	   Such a move could attract younger buyers more interested in
sporty vehicles than Cadillac's big cars. It would follow other
luxury automakers who are offering car-truck hybrids.
	   ``Cadillac clearly needs to be more than three four-door sedans
and one two-door coupe,'' said John Smith Jr. ``We need more
lifestyle vehicles.'' A large sport utility vehicle wouldn't make
sense because the automaker's GMC division is offering upscale
trucks, Smith said. Also, the market for large luxury sport
utilities isn't growing fast enough to justify a Cadillac entry.
	   Smith, 45, took over Feb. 1 from the retiring John
Grettenberger, 59. Smith was a vice president at GM Europe and most
recently ran the Allison Transmission division. He's considered a
protege of GM Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Smith Jr., who
is not related.
	   Smith oversees a division with declining sales. Cadillac sales
fell 6.2 percent to 170,379 in 1996. Cadillac and Ford Motor Co.'s
Lincoln division both have seen sales slip amid consumers' fading
interest in traditional American luxury cars.
	   GM is behind its competitors in offering a luxury hybrid, said
Lincoln Merrihew, an auto industry consultant with DRI/McGraw-Hill.
There's a ``go-anywhere image'' that is connecting with consumers
now.
	   ``Every luxury nameplate has to have an all-wheel-drive vehicle
or truck,'' Merrihew said. ``They're the only ones without it.''
	   Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus division and Mercedes are introducing
small luxury sport utilities. Lincoln is adding a full-sized model.
	   Smith said it's a challenge to figure out ways to appeal to
``post-Boomers'' -- consumers in their 20s who are likely to have
different ideas about luxury cars.
	   Cadillac stopped making its biggest car, the Fleetwood, last
year. This year it introduced the Catera, a German-built small
luxury car designed to draw younger, atypical Cadillac buyers.
	   It's unclear whether the Catera is a success yet. Sales are
improving now that the car is more readily available and after GM
cut the lease price to $399 a month, Smith said.
	   Smith said Cadillac must continue to lead in technological
enhancements and customer service.
	   ``It's this notion of anywhere-anytime customer service that I
think Cadillac should focus on,'' he said, citing the OnStar safety
and communications system that debuted on Cadillacs last year. He's
also interested in the potential of selling cars via the Internet.
Cadillac must offer styling that can turn heads, he said. It also
needs to capitalize on an image ``synonymous with luxury and
attainment.''
	   ``A lot of people are rooting for us as the embodiment of
American excellence,'' Smith said.
