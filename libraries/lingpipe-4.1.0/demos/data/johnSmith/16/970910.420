	   Washington, Sept. 10 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. producer prices
probably rose in August for the first time all year because of a
short-lived surge in energy costs that doesn't threaten an
otherwise bright inflation outlook, analysts said.
	   The Labor Department will release its latest reading on prices
paid to factories, farmers and other producers Friday, and analysts
expect that the index rose 0.3 percent last month, reflecting a pop
in gasoline and other energy costs.
	   Energy prices have dropped since the data were collected for the
August report. The October futures contract for unleaded gasoline
has fallen 7 percent since peaking Sept. 2 -- and analysts said
that means inflation should remain benign overall.
	   ``Away from what's happening at the pump, the trends are pretty
favorable,'' said Jim Glassman, an economist at Chase Securities
Inc. in New York. ``At least for the foreseeable future, there's
every reason to hope that inflation will remain fairly stable.''
	   Prices at the wholesale level haven't fallen so consistently
since Herbert Hoover was in the White House, and even consumer
prices are rising at their slowest pace in more than a decade.
Analysts credit the nation's low-inflation economy to increased
efficiency of businesses and workers, as U.S. companies battle
low-cost competition from abroad.
	   ``Higher productivity is allowing the economy to grow at a
healthy pace while helping to keep labor costs from rising,''
explained Cheryl Katz, an economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New
York. Those conditions will likely persuade Federal Reserve
policymakers to leave borrowing costs unchanged when they meet
later this month, though an interest rate increase may yet be in
the cards by year-end. Even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan sounds
sanguine. In a speech last week in California, he signaled the
central bank is in no hurry to alter monetary policy. ``The last 15
years have been a period of consolidating the gains of the early
1980s and extending them to their logical end -- the achievement of
price stability,'' Greenspan said. ``We are not quite there yet,
but we trust it is on the horizon.''
	   And just today, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President
William McDonough echoed those remarks. ``All the official data
continue to indicate that inflation is subdued,'' McDonough said,
speaking to reporters after a New York speech.
	   In financial markets today, government bonds fell for a second
day as investors braced for about $15 billion in sales of corporate
and asset-backed securities. The U.S. Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond fell 1/4, pushing up its yield 2 basis points to 6.65 percent.
	   Stocks fell, after European markets declined on concerns growth
in emerging markets could tail off. Gasoline and home heating oil
prices also fell. Another sign investors just aren't worried is
that gold, a traditional inflation hedge, has fallen steadily in
recent months, though the price was unchanged today.
	   Producer prices declined in each of the first seven months of
the year, the longest string of negative numbers since late 1930 to
mid-1931, according to the Labor Department. So far in 1997,
producer prices have fallen at a 3.1 percent annual rate. That
compares with an increase of 2.1 percent for the first seven months
of 1996.
	   What's more, the less volatile core rate of the producer price
index, which doesn't count food and energy costs, has also remained
tame. It probably rose just 0.1 percent in August, said analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.
	   Likewise, consumer prices through July rose at a 1.5 percent
annual rate -- down from a 3.4 percent increase for the first seven
months of 1996 and the slowest pace in 11 years, according to Labor
Department figures. Analysts expect August's consumer price report
next week to show a rise of 0.2 percent, matching July's increase.
	   Falling auto prices are one reason why inflation is likely to
remain under wraps. Auto executives have acknowledged that while
consumer demand for their products remains strong, buyers want
price cuts.
	   ``By and large, competitive pricing from the Japanese is the
real story,'' General Motors Corp. Chairman John Smith said today
in an interview at the IAA Frankfurt auto show.
	   Signs of subdued inflation continue to emerge on the wage front.
Take yesterday's Labor Department's report on second-quarter
productivity: Unit labor costs rose in the second quarter at just a
0.5 percent annual rate -- the most benign showing since a decline
three years ago.
	   Overall, non-farm productivity grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate
in the second quarter. That's the biggest gain in more than three
years. By squeezing more efficiencies out of workers and factories,
businesses have been able to hold onto their profit margins without
raising prices.
	   Taking that a step or two further, some analysts wonder whether
the Fed might reduce the overnight bank lending rate, instead of
raising it by a quarter point. In March, central bankers took out
an ``insurance policy'' against strong demand that could cause
inflation to accelerate, pushing up the overnight bank rate to 5.50
percent from 5.25 percent.
	   ``As long as inflation continues to stay where it is, or head
lower -- which I believe it will -- my belief is that the next move
by the Fed is to cut interest rates, not to raise them,'' said
Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens &
Thompson Inc. in Chicago.
	   August's anticipated rise in energy prices probably won't be
long-lived. Gasoline prices, which rose over the last month, are
likely to return to ``more normal levels soon, if not within the
month of September,'' the Energy Department said earlier this week.
	   Refinery problems and rising demand led to an ``atypical'' jump
in weekly average gasoline prices of more than 10 cents a gallon
between July 4 and Labor Day, the department said.
	   Normally, gasoline prices begin to rise as the weather turns
warmer in April and May. This year, prices declined all year before
rising in July. Crude oil prices have held fairly steady, and
accounted for only about 2 cents of the mid-year increase in
gasoline prices, the government said.
	   Still, a combination of ``strained'' refineries and brisk
consumer demand ``may ultimately send pump prices this month to
levels not seen since May of last year, and, before that, the Gulf
war in 1990,'' according to the Energy Department.
	   The agency estimates an average pump price for August of $1.31 a
gallon for all grades of gasoline, self-service or full-service.
While that's only one cent per gallon higher than last year, it's
the first time since March that average monthly prices haven't
dropped, according to the Energy Department.
	   Then again, stronger consumer spending could be considered
troubling for the inflation outlook -- if demand starts straining
capacity to produce and businesses start charging more because they
can no longer absorb higher production costs, analysts said.
	   ``Demand on the consumer side is very robust, and that's
problematic further down the road,'' said Tim O'Neill, chief
economist at Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal in Toronto. ``We may not
see a move by the Fed in September, but it will put pressure on the
Fed to move in November.'' After their Sept. 30 meeting, Fed
policymakers meet again on Nov. 12.
	   A separate Commerce Department report scheduled for Friday is
expected to show sales at the nation's retailers rose a healthy 0.7
percent during August following a 0.6 percent advance during July,
analysts said. Excluding autos, August retail sales probably
increased 0.6 percent.
