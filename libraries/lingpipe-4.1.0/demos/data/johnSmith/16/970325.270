	   Beijing, March 25 (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. and General Motors
Corp. today signed about $2.4 billion in contracts with China's
government in Beijing ceremonies witnessed by U.S. Vice President
Al Gore.
	   Seattle-based Boeing agreed to sell five 777-200 series
passenger jets to China's civil aviation authority. The $800
million sale had been about a year in the making.
	   GM unveiled a $1.57 billion joint venture with a Chinese
automaker, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp., to manufacture
100,000 Buick Regal and Century sedans a year in China.
	   Under the agreement with Boeing, Air China will receive three of
the 777s in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the other two in 1999.
	   The planes will cost $685 million. The contract also provides
for purchases of spare parts, and Boeing estimated that those
purchases will add another 15 percent to the value of the order.
	   Boeing's sale will provide work for some 4,500 parts suppliers
across the U.S., said a Gore spokeswoman, Lorraine Voles, and other
officials in his office. Parts suppliers could get as much as $120
billion in business during the next two decades, the officials
said.
	   The transaction bolsters the company's lead over rival Airbus
Industrie of Europe for business in the fast-growing Chinese
market. It also comes after a year in which Boeing's business in
China stalled over trade tensions with the U.S.
	   ``We're back to where we used to be in the relationship'' with
China, said Ron Woodard, president of Boeing's commercial airplane
group. Improved U.S.-Sino relations ``will keep from holding us
back,'' he said.
	   GM's agreement covers its biggest project in China, and follows
its selection in October 1995 as a 50-50 joint venture partner with
Shanghai Automotive Industry. Delays in obtaining government
approval put off the start of production until early 1999. GM's
chief executive, John Smith Jr., is in China this week.
	   Gore aides familiar with the plan said the GM Shanghai venture
would mean about $1.5 billion in U.S. exports in the first five
years of operation.
	   Boeing shares were unchanged at 105 3/4 yesterday and GM's rose
7/8 to close at 57 7/8.
	   While Gore didn't play a part in negotiating the Boeing and GM
agreements, his presence in China this week highlights U.S. efforts
to push big-ticket exports. Gore is the highest-ranking U.S. leader
to visit China since then-President George Bush visited in April
1989 -- just two months before China's People's Liberation Army
cracked down on student demonstrators outside Beijing's Tiananmen
Square.
	   Gore stands to improve U.S.-Sino relations just by traveling to
China, analysts said. ``Showing up, in this case, was 80 percent of
what he needed to do,'' said Arnold Kanter, senior associate at
Forum for International Policy in Washington.
	   Today's signings carried political weight for Premier Li Peng,
the man widely viewed as behind the 1989 crackdown, as he signed
for the Chinese.
	   Boeing and GM aside, Gore has other trade issues to discuss with
Li, President Jiang Zemin and other top Chinese officials during
his four-day stay.
	   They include a widening bilateral trade gap. U.S. figures
released last week showed a $3.7 billion trade deficit with China
in February, up from $2.7 billion a year ago. The disparity
suggests the trade gap the U.S. runs with China this year will
rival the deficit with Japan, and puts pressure on Gore to get
China to eliminate barriers to trade.
	   Gore might also announce measures to help China meet the
standards necessary to enter the World Trade Organization.
	   U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic
leader, and two other Democrats have introduced legislation that
would require congressional approval before the administration
could agree to let China join the WTO.
	   Although the Clinton administration said it will consult with
Congress, it wants to avoid a debate that would link China's human
rights record with its ability to join the world trade body.
	   Gore is meeting with top Chinese officials at a time when
critics say the administration has been too close to business
executives with interests in China. U.S. law enforcement agencies
and lawmakers in Congress are investigating whether China was
connected to possibly illegal contributions to U.S. election
campaigns last year. Beijing denies any wrongdoing.
	   ``It is a delicate time for him to be going ... Circumstances
have conspired to make it a less productive trip than some of us
would have hoped,'' said Kanter. ``We'll see more symbolism than
concrete accomplishments.''
	   Gore shouldn't let the controversies derail him from boosting
opportunities for U.S. businesses in China, said Robert Kapp,
president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a non-profit
association of more than 300 businesses and corporations.
	   ``If he returns home with the reinforced conviction that the
administration can and must engage fully with China, even on issues
of acute disagreement and acrimony . . . this visit may well be
counted a success for United States,'' Kapp said.
	   Controversies over fund raising and other issues eventually
``will fade'' and Gore ought to focus on trade, not public
relations, United Technologies Corp.'s president and chief
executive, George David, said earlier this month.
	   ``Gore needs to go to China understanding that it won't become
1997 America overnight,'' David said. ``He needs to cut them some
slack and concentrate on market access and the trade balance.''
	   United Technologies's Pratt & Whitney division makes engines for
the Boeing 777 jetliner. David was traveling and couldn't be
reached for comment on the Boeing sale. Mark Sullivan, a spokesman
for the division, said ``no customer has informed us of a Pratt &
Whitney engine selection.''
	   That's not so surprising, Sullivan said. Airplane purchases are
usually announced first, with engine sales to follow later.
	   Gore's trip to China follows a two-day visit to Japan and
meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. Both
leaders discussed economic issues, including financial services,
telecommunications and transportation, without announcing any
breakthroughs. After his China visit, he'll spend two days in South
Korea, meeting top officials there.
