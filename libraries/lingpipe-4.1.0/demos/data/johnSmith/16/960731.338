	   Rochester, Michigan, July 31 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors
Corp.'s chairman and chief executive said new cars and minivans the
company plans to sell soon will help the automaker regain market
share.
	   ``There's room to take share, there's no question in my mind
about that,'' John Smith Jr., GM chairman and chief executive, told
reporters at a luncheon in Rochester, Michigan.
	   General Motors, the world's largest automaker, has seen its U.S.
market share drop to 30 percent from 35 percent in 1991.
	   Part of the decline stems from GM efforts to reduce its
low-profit sales to rental car fleets, which can artificially
inflate market share. At the same time, GM competitors have
introduced some very popular cars and trucks.
	   GM is in early stages of production of its new Pontiac Grand
Prix, Saturn coupe and restyled minivans, all of which will be
introduced for the 1997 model year.
	   Smith also said the company was making strides to improve its
manufacturing efficiency to match the industry's best. GM currently
is the highest-cost producer in the U.S.
	   GM hopes to avoid a strike by successfully negotiating a new
contract this summer with the United Auto Workers, Smith said. GM
last week settled a dispute with a union local leader who was fired
for alleged time-card fraud. GM reinstated Al Alli as head of Local
1112 at its Lordstown, Ohio, plant.
	   ``It's something we needed to get behind us,'' Smith said.
