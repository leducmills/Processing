	   Detroit, Aug. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The United Auto Workers union
delayed selecting a company to kick off formal contract talks with,
saying it first wanted to meet with the chief executives of the
three U.S. automakers.
	   UAW President Stephen Yokich then met separately for at least an
hour with chief executives Robert Eaton of Chrysler Corp., Alex
Trotman of Ford Motor Co. and finally with John Smith Jr. of
General Motors Corp.
	   Yokich, who was expected to pick Chrysler as the union's
``strike target,'' may have had second thoughts because, he said,
the union has made significant strides with all three automakers
during the 11 weeks of preliminary negotiations.
	   ``When you have three companies, moving along, making progress,
you don't want to stop them,'' Yokich said at a press conference at
which he had been expected to announce the decision.
	   However, Yokich may simply be pitting the automakers against
each other to get a clearer signal about which company would agree
to the contract mostble to the union. This tactic also takes
the pressure off the union to single out one company. ``This makes
it so the UAW is not the bad guy,'' said James Wheeler, financial
secretary of Local 599 in Flint, Michigan.
	   The union's choice may come as early as Monday, though it wasn't
clear whether Yokich wants additional meetings with the chief
executives beyond today's.
	   Aside from a ceremonial handshake at the beginning, the chief
executives haven't participated in any of the preliminary
negotiations. It's unusual for them to become involved before
formal talks have even begun.
	   All three chief executives have said they want their company to
be the target so they can forge a contract that their competitors
must follow. The current contract expires Sept. 14.
	   Yokich was expected to pick Chrysler because the automaker is
doing so well and might be hurt the most by a strike.
	   General Motors, however, was a close second choice because it
presents the union with some of its most difficult problems,
especially GM's desire to send more work to outside parts
suppliers.
	   But union leaders indicated they may break with the traditional
selection of a target company at all because negotiations at all
three companies are going well.
	   ``We are moving quicker and have more out of the way than in the
past,'' said Jack Laskowski, a UAW vice president and head of the
Chrysler bargaining team. But he added that critical issues at all
three companies ``have not been resolved.''
	   The longer the companies continue to negotiate, the more
flexibility they have to address their particular problems. This is
especially important for General Motors, which is the most
inefficient U.S. auto manufacturer and has more people retiring
over the next eight years than the other automakers do.
	   GM hopes it won't need to replace a lot of the retirees as it
becomes more efficient, while the union has been trying, at least
up to now, to maintain as many union jobs as possible.
	   ``It appears as though they recognize that they do have to make
certain accommodations to GM in order to get this company on a
globally competitive footing,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst
with Lehman Brothers.
	   The UAW, which represents 415,000 workers at the three
companies, hasn't delayed its decision on a target since 1984, when
it picked both GM and Ford.
	   GM shares gained 3/8 to close at 51 1/2. Ford rose 1/2 to end at
34, while Chrysler gained 1/8 to 29 3/4.
	   In Canada, the Canadian Auto Workers union said it wasn't
delaying its choice of a company to begin talks with because of the
UAW delay. The Canadian union, which isn't part of the UAW, said it
still will announce its choice next Wednesday.
	   Contracts of about 53,000 Canadian auto workers also expire
Sept. 14.
