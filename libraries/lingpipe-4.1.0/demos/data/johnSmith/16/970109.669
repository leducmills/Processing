
	   DETROIT , Bringing to an end a four-year feud between two of the
world's largest companies, Volkswagen AG agreed on Thursday to pay
$100 million to General Motors Corp. to settle a lawsuit contending
that VW stole trade secrets from GM.
	   In the settlement, one of the largest in a corporate espionage
case, Volkswagen also agreed to buy at least $1 billion worth of
auto parts from the American company over the next seven years.
While not admitting any wrongdoing, VW said that it ``acknowledges
the possibility that illegal activities'' by a team of executives
who defected from GM to VW may have occurred.
	   While the agreement means that both companies can go back to
building cars rather than legal cases, the central figure in the
case, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, still faces criminal charges
in Germany. And the Justice Department is still looking into the
matter.
	   The $100 million payment is only a fraction of the $3 billion to
$4 billion that GM is said to have demanded. And a GM spokesman
said Volkswagen already buys about $300 million a year in parts
from GM, meaning that the pact does not require any additional
purchase, though GM apparently had been canceling some of those
contracts.
	   But some analysts said the dispute was never about money.
	   ``It is more the feelings involved among top people at GM than
it is the bucks,'' said David Healy, a longtime auto analyst at
Burnham Securities.
	   Still, in the carefully worded statements on the settlement,
Volkswagen apparently did not give in to GM's previous insistence
that it explicitly apologize for the Lopez affair.
	   The feud began when Lopez, a charismatic Spaniard in the
buttoned-down world of auto executives, left GM for VW in 1993,
spurning a promotion offered by John Smith Jr., GM's chief
executive. Lopez specialized in one of the most mundane parts of
the auto business: managing the purchases of everything from seat
belts to windshield wipers from suppliers. When GM was hemorrhaging
money in the early 1990s, he drastically reduced its purchasing
costs by demanding that suppliers accept lower payments, and he was
credited by some people with revolutionizing the way auto parts
were bought by car companies.
	   When Lopez left to take a similar position at Volkswagen, seven
of his lieutenants followed. But GM has said that is not all he
took: GM filed a racketeering lawsuit in federal court in Detroit
against Volkswagen and the executives, accusing them of stealing
thousands of pages of company documents full of trade secrets. The
suit also named Volkswagen and its chief executive, Ferdinand
Piech, and a board member, Jens Neumann.
	   Last month, prosecutors in Darmstadt, Germany, indicted Lopez
and three of the executives he brought with him. But they did not
name Volkswagen or its senior officials. Lopez and one of the
indicted executives resigned in November and the other two had
agreed to resign or take administrative leave by the end of the
month.
	   The lawyer for Lopez, Plato Cacheris, said he had briefed Lopez
on the settlement and that the executive ``was very pleased that
the case had been settled,'' even though the accord would not end
the criminal case.
	   But Cacheris said that he hoped the settlement would persuade
the Justice Department to drop its investigation of the matter. ``I
would hope that given the fact that these parties have settled, the
Justice Department would see fit to terminate their
investigation,'' Cacheris said.
	   Lopez ``has always taken the position that he did not do
anything that was improper,'' Cacheris said.
	   Volkswagen, which is based in Wolfsburg, Germany, has denied
that the company, its executives or its board members engaged in a
conspiracy with Lopez. It has admitted receiving some GM material,
but has said it never used the information.
	   Still, the Darmstadt indictment, combined with a succession of
preliminary rulings against Volkswagen in the Detroit case, had put
pressure on the German auto maker to settle. GM was under pressure
to settle because Volkswagen planned to file a 50-page countersuit
in Detroit on Friday, accusing GM of defamation.
	   On-again off-again settlement talks had been held during the
last several months, but hard-line remarks by GM executives in
Europe, as well as VW's refusal to issue an outright apology,
fueled tensions between the two companies. Settlement talks began
in earnest on Monday in Washington at the offices of Volkswagen's
lawyer, Robert Strauss of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld.
	   The lead negotiator for General Motors was Thomas Gottschalk,
its general counsel and senior vice president, who closely
consulted with Smith and with John Smale, a leading GM board
member.
	   Volkswagen's negotiating team was led by Strauss and Neumann,
who supervises Volkswagen's U.S. operations and is a member of the
board of management. They consulted with Klaus Liesen, chairman of
the Volkswagen board of supervisors, and with Piech, the company's
chairman.
	   The letters exchanged were signed by Smith and Smale on behalf
of GM and by Liesen and Piech of Volkswagen. A person close to the
discussions said the settlement was made possible mostly because
the executives who had most harshly spoken out were left out of the
talks.
