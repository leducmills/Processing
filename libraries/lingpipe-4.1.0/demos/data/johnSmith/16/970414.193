	   Detroit, April 14 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s
first-quarter profit more than doubled, topping expectations, as it
boosted U.S. production from the strike-plagued year-ago quarter
and racked up its best earnings in North America in more than a
decade.
	   GM said profit from continuing operations rose to $1.80 billion,
or $2.30 a share, from $800 million, or 93 cents.
	   The company was expected to earn $2.09 a share, the average
estimate in a survey of 13 analysts by First Call Corp.
	   ``It was somewhat better than I expected,'' said Burnham
Securities analyst David Healy. Earnings in Europe and at financial
subsidiary General Motors Acceptance Corp. were higher than he had
estimated, he said.
	   GM said car and truck earnings in North America rose to $764
million from a loss of $279 million. Earnings in North America,
where it makes Chevrolet, Cadillac, Saturn and other vehicles, were
still lower than he expected, Healy said.
	   In addition, the company's repurchase of 27 million shares for
$1.6 billion helped boost the per-share figure by spreading the
earnings over fewer shares, he said. The company began a 12-month,
$2.5 billion stock buyback program announced in January.
	   GM shares rose 5/8 to 53 5/8 in midmorning trading.
	   Revenue for the quarter increased to $42.3 billion from $39.2
billion.
	   GM's international car and truck business, which sells Opel,
Vauxhall and other brands, earned $317 million, down from $432
million, because of slower sales and higher incentives in Europe
and lower earnings from Saab AB, the Swedish carmaker that GM half
owns.
	   Earnings in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region rose to
$168 million from $147 million.
	   GM's share of the worldwide car and truck market fell to 15.1
percent from 15.8 percent in the year-earlier quarter. In the U.S.,
its largest market, its share sank to 30.2 percent from 31.2
percent.
	   GM officials say the company will gain in the U.S. market
beginning at mid-year as Chevrolet Malibu, Pontiac Grand Prix cars,
Chevrolet Venture minivans and more than a dozen other new car and
truck models become more available at dealers.
	   In the most recent quarter, the company booked a one-time gain
of $55 million, or 7 cents a share, from Volkswagen AG's payment to
settle GM's industrial espionage lawsuit against VW. GM also
recorded a one-time charge of $50 million, also 7 cents, to close a
New Jersey parts plant.
	   In the year-earlier first quarter, GM recorded a gain of $72
million, or 7 cents a share, on the sale of a partial interest in
its Hughes Electronics subsidiary's DirecTV business.
	   Also, a 17-day strike at two Ohio brake plants in March 1996 cut
the automaker's North American production and reduced earnings by
$900 million, or $1.20 a share.
	   Excluding the strike impact and the one-time gains and charges,
profit from continuing operations rose to $1.79 billion from $1.02
billion.
	   The company's net profit margin rose to 4.8 percent from 2.3
percent, but was still below the company goal of 5 percent.
	   ``It's clear that we are headed in the right direction to
further strengthen the corporation's financial performance,'' said
Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr.
	   The automaker said it had $14.6 billion in cash at the end of
the quarter, nearly double the year-earlier level.
