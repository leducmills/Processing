	   Detroit, Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Republican presidential
candidate Bob Dole blasted President Bill Clinton's spending
policies, saying they've created the ``slowest economic recovery in
a century.''
	   Dole, speaking to 1,550 business people at the Economic Club of
Detroit, said the Clinton administration supports big government,
high taxes and big spending. ``They have a spend and tax agenda,''
Dole said. ``They just don't want to let the American people in on
their secret.''
	   Dole, who trails Clinton by double digits in the polls, said
Americans feel anxious about the economy. He said bankruptcies hit
a record 1 million in 1995, productivity gains are lower and wages
are stagnant. ``I'm saying we can do better,'' said Dole.
	   Clinton strategists, for their part, say the voters will give
their man credit for a solid economy that's grown at a 2.5 percent
annual pace during his presidency. ``I am very pleased we have
strong growth and no signs of inflation, and I feel good about
that,'' Clinton said today.
	   The economy rebounded to a 4.8 percent annual rate in the
April-June quarter and unemployment dropped to 5.1 percent, a
seven-year low, in August.
	   Today, the Federal Reserve policymakers in Washington left the
federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 percent. The decision came
after Dole's speech.
	   In Detroit, Dole outlined his plan for the economy, which
includes cutting federal income taxes 15 percent; offering a $500
per child tax credit; ending capital gains taxes for all
homeowners; and balancing the federal budget by the year 2002.
	   The Dole plan would cut $1,261 from the tax bill of a family of
four earning $30,000 a year, he said.
	   ``All these measures are based on one simple belief: The money
belongs to you, the people who earn it, not the government that
taxes it,'' Dole told the economic club.
	   He said he'll work harder in the campaign's remaining six weeks
to tell Americans about his plan and how it will be paid for. Some
economists have questioned whether the tax cuts and balanced budget
can be achieved together.
	   Dole said economists who support his plan have called it
``Economics 101.'' The balanced budget program that Congress passed
in June will generate savings to help pay for the tax cuts and so
will revenue growth from a stronger economy and higher incomes, he
said. Dole would sell some unneeded federal buildings and other
government assets to generate more cash, he said.
	   Some audience members weren't convinced. ``I'm skeptical,'' of
the Dole economic plan, said Linda Wyatt, a human resources manager
from Northville, Michigan. She described herself as a Republican
but added, ``I don't know if I'm a Dole supporter.''
	   Wyatt said she wanted to read Dole's new book, ``Trusting the
People,'' which is due at bookstores this week, before deciding
about the former Kansas senator.
	   Others were more supportive in the audience, which included
General Motors Corp. Chairman and CEO John Smith Jr. and
millionaire Republican fundraiser Max Fisher.
	   Peter Zachary, a retired Ford Motor Co. manager from Dearborn,
Michigan, said Dole needs to communicate his plan more to voters
more clearly. If he does, he'll win the election, said Zachary, who
bought a Dole campaign lapel pin after the speech.
	   ``If he explains it successfully, I bet that people will buy
it,'' said Zachary.
	   Dole was introduced by Michigan Gov. John Engler, who compared
his own come-from-behind gubernatorial victory six years ago to
Dole's current standing in the polls.
	   ``They said I was dead and buried, they said I couldn't win,''
said the governor, who was considered as a possible Dole running
mate.
	   Engler, a former state senator, defeated incumbent Democratic
Gov. James Blanchard by 17,000 votes in 1990 and was re-elected in
1994. He said he's confident that Dole will sweep Michigan and win
the U.S. election.
	   ``When people ask me about Bob Dole's chances in November, I say
`They look pretty good to me,''' Engler said.
	   Dole called Michigan a ``battleground state.''
	   ``We're going to be here a lot,'' he said. He was scheduled to
campaign in Ohio later today.
