	   Stockholm, June 24 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. said it
will pump more money into Saab Automobile AB and could obtain full
ownership of the struggling Swedish automaker within three years.
	   GM and Saab co-owner Investor AB each will inject $262 million,
or a total of $524 million, in loans into Saab. In addition, GM
will receive an option to buy some or all of Investor's 50 percent
stake in Saab in 1999 or 2000.
	   The move continues GM's recent efforts to make its Saab
investment pay off by taking greater control of the automaker. GM
is hoping it can do with Saab what Ford Motor Co. has done with the
once-ailing Jaguar Plc, but Saab's success is far from assured,
analysts say.
	   ``Saab has proven to be something of a black hole for cash for
GM,'' said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. ``At some point
they have to decide to fish or cut bait.''
	   GM is betting that new models and a pumped-up marketing budget
will boost worldwide sales enough to make Saab more than the minor
global automaker it is today, with two models and a market share of
only 0.2 percent in the U.S., its largest market. Its sales last
year were $3.01 billion.
	   ``What we are doing aims to increase sales volumes by more than
50 percent in the next five years,'' said Louis Hughes, Saab Auto
chairman, in a statement. Hughes also is president of GM's
international operations.
	   Saab's future ``is really difficult to forecast right now,''
said Gunnar Andersson, analyst at Handelsbanken. ``Everything
hinges on the success of the new models.''
	   GM shares fell 3/8 at 54 1/2 in late trading.
	   GM has pumped $1.1 billion into Saab, not including the loans
announced today, since the Detroit-based automaker acquired its 50
percent stake for $600 million in 1990. Saab has turned an annual
profit only twice since then and isn't expected to be consistently
profitable for four more years, its chief executive, Keith
Butler-Wheelhouse has said.
	   GM's new assertiveness includes the naming on June 10 of
U.S.-based GM executive Robert Hendry as Saab's new president and
chief executive. He will replace Butler-Wheelhouse, who is leaving
after four years to become chief executive of UK manufacturer Smith
Industries Plc.
	   Hendry has close ties to GM Chairman and CEO John Smith Jr.
	   Saab also named a former executive of GM's Saturn division, Joel
Manby, as president and chief executive of its sales and
distribution arm. Saab has been studying the well-regarded sales
and marketing operations of Saturn.
	   To survive in the global auto market, carmakers need a wide
product range and high volumes, industry analysts say. Saab will
use its new funds to try to reach those thresholds.
	   Next spring, it plans to introduce a third car model to
complement its 900 and 9000 series. Within a few years the
carmaker, known for its luxury, sporty look, will make a station
wagon. Company officials have said a compact car is not out of the
question.
	   Between the introduction of next year's new top model and the
station wagon ``a number of other versions of the new model and
existing models will appear,'' said Olle Axelsson, information
chief of Saab Auto.
	   To sell the new cars, Saab will double what it usually invests
in marketing and sales in the next five years to 20 percent of
sales.
	   GM hopes to emulate Ford's success at Jaguar, which Ford bought
for $2.5 billion in 1989. It then invested heavily in the U.K.
company, cut jobs and restructured operations. Jaguar productivity,
product quality and sales all have risen as a result.
	   In the past, GM has denied that it plans to take full control of
Saab. A GM spokesman would say only that today's announcement
indicates that Investor AB and GM are working to improve Saab.
	   ``What we're committed to is the success of Saab,'' said GM
spokesman Mark Tanner.
	   Analysts said today's announcement indicates GM has felt stymied
by having to split responsibility with Investor and may see
eventual full control as a way to halt Saab's losses.
	   Investor is the holding company for the Wallenberg family of
Sweden, which has controlled Saab since its founding 59 years ago.
GM sought the option to buy Investor's stake, an Investor spokesman
said.
	   ``We didn't want the option that GM could buy all the shares,''
said spokesman Nils-Ingmar Lundin. ``We would have preferred to
keep something, but that's the name of the game,'' in arrangements
like this.
	   GM and Stockholm-based Investor refused to discuss what it would
cost to exercise the options. They said they'll conduct an overall
review of Saab Auto in the second half of 1999 before making any
decisions.
	   Investor had booked the value of its stake in Saab Auto as of
March 31 at $446 million (2.966 billion kronor).
	   Saab made mainly aircraft until 1949, when it also began
manufacturing cars. Saab AB was merged with truckmaker Scania in
1969, to form Saab-Scania AB. Saab Automobile AB didn't become a
separate entity until 1990, when GM bought its half of the company.
	   Earlier this year, Investor sold more than half of Scania in one
of the world's largest private initial public offerings.
	   The sale option on Saab Auto is motivated by Investor's
``sticking to the idea of being a holding company, without joint
ventures or management responsibility,'' Investor's Lundin said.
	   Under the new agreement, Marcus Wallenberg will leave Saab
Auto's board, and Anders Rydin, deputy vice president at Investor,
will join the board.
	   In Stockholm, Investor shares rose 6 kronor to 247.
