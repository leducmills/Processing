	   Toronto, Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) A strike by General Motors of Canada
Ltd. workers approached the end of its first full day Thursday with
no sign of a settlement and mounting speculation about the impact
an extended walkout might have on GM's U.S. operations.
	   Wednesday night, 15,000 members of the Canadian Auto Workers
walked off the job at GM plants in Oshawa, Ontario, and Ste.
Therese, Quebec. The union said the strike will spread to all GM
plants in Canada by midnight next Wednesday if the company doesn't
offer an acceptable agreement, particularly on the pivotal issue of
outsourcing, or GM's desire to farm parts work out to less costly
outside companies.
	   United Auto Workers officials in the U.S. estimated that all GM
operations in the U.S. would grind to a halt 10 days after a
complete Canadian shutdown. The Canadian walkout also complicates
the UAW's own negotiations with GM in the U.S., where outsourcing
also is a key issue.
	   In Ottawa, Finance Minister Paul Martin said the Liberal
government was monitoring the dispute closely. ``I think it is
very, very important for the Canadian economy - which is obviously
very dependent on automobile assembly - that the strike be
settled,'' he said.
	   Exports of vehicles and parts account for almost a third of all
Canadian exports. Most of those are sent to the U.S., where
automakers depend on production from the North to keep lines
running smoothly.
	   Analysts say the Canadian strike would have to last several
weeks before GM really felt it, though availability of some
products could be crippled sooner.
	   ``They have enough inventory that it would take three or four
weeks before it would start biting into sales, except in the case
of the pickup trucks,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst with
Bear Stearns & Co.
	   The struck Oshawa complex builds 35 percent of all of GM's
full-size GMC and Chevrolet pickup trucks, and all of the popular
three-door models of those pickups.
	   The Canadian strike also could disrupt GM's ambitious product
introduction plans, as the Oshawa plants are being retooled to
build the redesigned Buick Century car, which is supposed to be on
the market next month.
	   ``You would hate to be launching a brand-new vehicle and then
not be able to deliver,'' said Wes Brown, a senior analyst at CSM
Forecasting, a consulting company in Farmington Hills, Michigan.
	   GM Canada and the striking autoworkers continued to talk
Thursday. Union president Basil ``Buzz'' Hargrove said GM's refusal
to accept the concept of ``work ownership'' is a major obstacle to
a settlement. The union argues that GM shouldn't be allowed to farm
out work adequately performed, or ``owned,'' by GM workers.
	   Two weeks ago, Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian company reached a new
contract with the CAW without a strike, after the company agreed to
maintain a certain level of jobs.
	   ``We have Chrysler saying there is nothing wrong with the
principal of committing to your workforce that as long they're
producing high-quality products, in a productive manner, at
reasonably low cost, and we're making a reasonable profit, that we
will not sell their jobs to the lowest bidder,'' Hargrove said.
	   GM remained adamantly against the notion of work ownership. ``We
view it as an impediment to getting more competitive,'' said Stew
Low, a GM spokesman.
	   The union has called an escalating strike, meaning more workers
will strike as time goes by. If the strike isn't settled by Sunday,
workers at a St. Catharines, Ontario, operations will join the
picket lines. GM builds axles for its very profitable Tahoe and
Suburban sport utility vehicles in St. Catharines.
	   GM's remaining plants would be shut down Wednesday. A strike at
GM's transmission plant in Windsor, Ontario, would threaten the
introduction of the new Chevrolet Malibu to be built in Oklahoma
City.
	   ``Within a week, that would shut them down in Oklahoma,'' Brown
said. ``The new Malibu is supposed to be a very strong competitor,
and GM really doesn't need any problems.''
	   The Canadian transmission plant also is the sole source of
four-speed transmissions for the Pontiac Sunfire and Oldsmobile
Achieva cars. GM also makes all of its Chevrolet Lumina and Monte
Carlo cars in Canada.
	   Some analysts predicted a short strike. ``In a couple of days,
the union will sign an agreement and claim victory,'' Lobaccaro
said.
	   But the tough-talking Hargrove said the CAW could weather a
12-week strike because it has C$100 million in cash and assets and
will ask its 215,000 members Oct. 18 for a temporary dues increase.
``We can last as long as General Motors,'' Hargrove said yesterday.
GM has 28,500 Canadian workers.
	   In the U.S., meanwhile, UAW President Stephen Yokich was at GM
headquarters in Detroit Thursday morning and was expected to return
after briefing UAW members about a new agreement reached with
Chrysler on Sunday.
	   Yokich said GM Chairman John Smith Jr., who canceled a planned
trip to an auto show in Paris this week, was making himself
available to negotiators.
	   ``I can't tell you at this point'' whether the UAW might agree
to a settlement before the Canada dispute is settled, Yokich said.
	   The UAW, which represents 220,000 GM workers, would like GM to
agree to maintain 95 percent of its workforce, as Ford and Chrysler
have promised to do.
	   But GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, says it needs to cut
far more jobs than such a pledge would allow it to cut.
