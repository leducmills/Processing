	   (Rewrites, adding quotes from Rev. Jackson speech today,
responses from companies, Mitsubishi sales)
	   New York, Jan. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing
of America and its U.S. sales unit reached an agreement with the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and others that will end a boycott against the
company stemming from charges of sexual harassment at a Mitsubishi
factory in the U.S.
	   The boycotting groups also protested the company's alleged
failure to offer enough jobs and dealerships to minorities.
	   Jackson, head of The Rainbow/Operation PUSH Coalition, which
coordinated the boycott, will announce the agreement tomorrow in
New York at a joint press conference with Mitsubishi
representatives including former Labor Secretary Lynn Martin.
Martin was hired by the company to study its workplace environment
and recommend ways to improve it.
	   The agreement calls in part for Mitsubishi to make workplace
improvements and employ more minority workers and dealers, a
spokesman for the coalition group said.
	   Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, the U.S. sales arm of
Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp., said sales dropped 6.1
percent last year to 187,126 vehicles, but a spokesman said that
may have been because the company had two fewer models to sell last
year.
	   ``The impact of the boycott is hard to analyze,'' said spokesman
Kim Custer. ``But it has been worrisome,''
	   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Mitsubishi
Motor Manufacturing in April, after investigating charges that as
many as 700 women were grabbed, assaulted and subjected to obscene
phone calls at the company's car plant in Normal, Illinois.
	   The Normal plant employs 4,000 people and is the company's only
U.S. plant.
	   Earlier today, Jackson said the Operation PUSH coalition will
open a Wall Street office as part of its effort to get companies to
step up minority participation.
	   Jackson said his organization also wants to create an ``urban
America development bank'' to pay for improvements in inner cities
by using public and private pension funds.
	   The organization's new office at 40 Wall Street will monitor
major corporations' efforts to provide minority jobs and training,
Jackson said.
	   ``We're looking for jobs and economic opportunity,'' he told the
Automotive News World Congress in Detroit. He met for about 90
minutes with GM Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. this
morning.
	   Jackson called on foreign automakers to increase opportunities
for blacks and other minorities. He said Honda Motor Co.,
Daimler-Benz AG, Toyota Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. were among
the foreign companies that have failed to offer enough
distributorships to minorities.
	   ``We're actively recruiting'' minority dealers, said Dick
Colliver, senior vice president of Honda Motor Co.'s U.S. sales
division. But he said the company hasn't been increasing its total
number of dealers, which he said makes the addition of
minority-owned showrooms more difficult.
	   Honda has about 50 minority dealers, including four blacks,
among its 1,000 dealers, he said.
	   ``We completely agree with Rev. Jackson,'' said Mike Michels, a
spokesman for the Torrance, California-based Lexus Division of
Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., which is the U.S. sales unit of
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. ``We would like to have greater minority
representation at the dealership level.''
	   Michels said Lexus is working with the Washington-based National
Association of Minority Automobile Dealers to find minorities who
have enough capital and experience to qualify for a Lexus
dealership.
	   Lexus has 174 U.S. dealerships, of which four are
minority-owned. The Toyota Division has about 1,200 dealerships, or
which 3.7 percent are minority-owned. That is roughly the same
percentage as that of Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler Corp., Michels said.
	   ``We're very surprised that we would be singled out by Rev.
Jackson,'' said Donna Boland, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz of
North America, the luxury car unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG.
	   Boland said that of its 330 dealerships, 25, or nearly 8
percent, are minority owned. In 1996, 15.1 million vehicles were
sold in the U.S., of which Mercedes sold 90,000, or less than 1
percent, she said.
