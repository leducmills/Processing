	   (Adds detail about meeting, Ford spokesman's comments)
	   Washington, Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- President Bill Clinton will
discuss how to cut carbon dioxide emissions at a meeting tomorrow
with the chief executives of Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp.
and Chrysler Corp. at the White House.
	   When Clinton last met with Ford chairman and chief executive
Alex Trotman, GM Chairman John Smith and Chrysler's chairman,
president and CEO Robert Eaton in June, the topic was economic
issues. This time around Clinton is trying to recruit help from the
Big Three automakers in efforts to cut gases that scientists say
contribute to global warming and hurt the environment.
	   ``We need to put greater emphasis on this partnership with
Detroit, developing a new generation of vehicles, we need to
institute cooperative measures to trade emissions and we need to
set some broad goals for emissions levels that are realistic and
achievable,'' Vice President Al Gore said today.
	   Emissions of so-called greenhouse gases are running ahead of
1990 levels and the U.S. and other countries are trying to bring
them below 1990 levels by 1992.
	   Clinton is trying to defuse opposition to his anticipated
announcement of targets and timetables for reduction of greenhouse
gases. Automakers fear the Clinton administration will lead to them
being saddled with costly new regulations. Ford's Trotman said
today the world treaty the U.S. is expected to sign in December in
Kyoto is ``ill-advised'' and he expects it will result in a sharp
drop in living standards of advanced industrial countries.
	   Also on the agenda at tomorrow's meeting will be Clinton's
efforts to get Congress to renew a special negotiating authority,
known as fast track, that makes it easier to negotiate trade
agreements, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
	   ``They will discuss a range of issues from trade and the opening
of markets for U.S. vehicles to the state of the economy,'' said
McCurry. He said the meeting was not set up to coincide with the
release of a Super 301 report expected this week in which South
Korea and Japan will likely come under fire for their trade
barriers against foreign autos.
	   Even so, while the Super 301 report isn't specifically on the
agenda, U.S. automakers' concerns about South Korea's violation of
key provisions of a 1995 accord aimed at opening its markets to
U.S. vehicles and their continued beefs with Japan over market
access are likely to come up.
	   The industry leaders will press Clinton to take tougher steps to
limit a growing deficit in automotive trade with Japan, Bill Day, a
Ford spokesman said today.
	   Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers
Association which represents the big three U.S. automakers, charged
last week that Korea has failed to discourage bureaucrats from
taking measures that hobble foreign car sales.
	   One major U.S. concern is Korea's failure to stop threatening
tax audits on consumers who buy foreign cars, adding to the
perception that Korean consumer shouldn't buy imported vehicles.
	   The auto parts market in Japan is another point of contention.
U.S. Trade Rep. Charlene Barshefsky and Commerce Secretary William
Daley have told Japanese officials that the pace and scope of
Japanese deregulation in its auto parts market has been too slow.
	   The two sent a letter to the Japanese Transport Ministry in
August saying Japan hasn't opened its markets to the extent called
for under a 1995 bilateral auto agreement. Big Three automakers are
trying to crack the Japanese parts market as well.
	   Gore met with the auto industry leaders in Detroit in April.
