	   Detroit, Oct. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Labor negotiations between
General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers intensified as the
two sides raced to beat a midnight deadline.
	   GM's Chairman John Smith Jr. arrived at the company's
headquarters in Detroit this evening, indicating the bargaining has
reached the highest levels.
	   Yet 20 miles away at an assembly plant in Pontiac, Michigan,
workers were making picket signs in preparation of a strike. The
union's 220,000 members at General Motors are threatening to walk
off the job if a labor contract isn't reached by 11:59 East Coast
time Sunday.
	   ``We are getting ready in case we're called on to go. We are one
of the key plants,'' said Carl Forester, a shop committeeman at
local 594, where they build the popular GMC and Chevrolet full-size
pickup trucks.
	   General Motors just settled a 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto
Workers on Monday and won't have all of its operations running
again before Nov. 10. Another strike would compound the estimated
$300 million in losses from the Canadian walkout.
	   Some analysts were pessimistic that the United Auto Workers and
General Motors can settle their disagreements over job security.
The union wants GM to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of its workers,
but the company wants to exclude many of its facilities from the
agreement. ``If they haven't talked it out by now, I don't think
they ever will,'' said Dale Brickner, a labor relations professor
at Michigan State University.
	   Talks broke off at 7 p.m. yesterday, with some union officials
saying little progress was made.
	   Negotiations resumed midmorning today. Union bargainers,
lingering outside the meeting room during breaks today, declined to
comment on the talks, which began last June.
	   If there is no agreement, the union could choose to break off
talks and strike, or extend or the deadline and continue
negotiations.
	   Union officials at locals around the country were meeting today
and making preparations for a walkout, should the union leadership
in Detroit order one. The union could call a partial strike,
ordering pickets only at select assembly plants that produce
profitable models, like full-size pickup trucks and sport utility
vehicles, to pressure GM into settling.
	   ``If the union leadership thinks it would be advantageous to
target this plant, we'll be ready,'' said Yvonne Smith, vice
president of UAW Local 1999 in Oklahoma City.
	   The Oklahoma City plant builds the new 1997-model Oldsmobile
Cutlass, one of more than a dozen new models that GM is introducing
this year and next.
	   Strikes at Oklahoma City and eight other North American plants
could delay the introduction of these new cars and trucks, which
analysts said could also hurt GM's bottom line.
	   Early last week, the major remaining issue was what level of job
security the company would offer.
	   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., in agreements reached in
September with the union, offered job guarantees for 95 percent of
their UAW employees.
	   That's what the union has sought at GM, but the company has
balked. The company said its plants are less efficient than its
competitors and it must cut its workforce more sharply.
	   A union spokesman declined to say if progress is being made, and
a company spokesman said the company was hopeful that a settlement
could be reached.
	   ``We're trying to resolve some very difficult and complex
issues,'' said GM spokesman Chuck Licari.
	   GM reached an agreement Tuesday with the Canadian Auto Workers
union that ended a three-week strike that shut down all GM's
Canadian plants, closed all or part of six other North American
assembly plants.
