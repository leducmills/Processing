	   Wilmington, Delaware, May 23 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.
won't accept any strike settlements that damage the company's
financial health, Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. said,
indicating the automaker is willing to absorb for now the costs of
two continuing assembly-plant strikes.
	   ``We must make General Motors competitive and avoid settlements
that damage us for the long term,'' Smith said at the company's
annual shareholders meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. He added that
the company wants to ``build constructive relationships'' with
labor unions.
	   The United Auto Workers went on strike last month at GM's
Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Michigan, plants. The union wants more
workers at the plants, but the company says current levels are
adequate.
	   GM said the walkouts cost it $225 million in profit through May
15. Strikes last year cost GM $1.2 billion.
	   Negotiators have made little progress so far, both sides said.
	   ``I wouldn't have thought it would have gone on this long,''
said G. Richard Wagoner, head of GM's North American automotive
business.
	   The Oklahoma City plant makes Chevrolet Malibu cars, one of the
company's most important new models, and Oldsmobile Cutlasses. The
Pontiac plant makes full-size, extended-cab pickup trucks, among
the company's most profitable vehicles.
	   UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said the union ``is frustrated by the
fact that the company has dragged this out as long as it has.''
	   The Oklahoma strike hurt Malibu and Cutlass sales last month, GM
said, and analysts say the company's sales are being crippled even
more this month.
	   GM's total U.S. sales in May will fall below May 1996 sales,
which were exceptionally strong because of pent-up demand following
a March 1996 strike at a GM parts plant in Dayton, Ohio, Wagoner
said.
	   GM, like other automakers, is using more cash-back deals to spur
sales, he said. ``It's not a weak market but it's a pretty tough
market, a pretty expensive market,'' Wagoner said.
	   Smith told shareholders that GM has begun to grow and not just
recover from its profit and market share declines of recent years.
The company wants to boost its international sales to 5 million
vehicles a year by 2006 from last year's 3 million, he said, and
its North American car and truck business is becoming more
profitable.
	   ``General Motors intends to be a growth company once again,''
Smith said.
	   GM is continuing efforts to consolidate its sprawling worldwide
operations. A more efficient worldwide parts purchasing business
saved $150 million last quarter, Smith said.
	   The company also told shareholders it has stopped making ``soft
money'' contributions to political parties, which have been
criticized by political analysts as being difficult to trace.
	   ``We didn't feel it was appropriate to make those contributions
not knowing how that money would be used,'' Vice Chairman Harry
Pearce said. The ban began six months ago, he said.
	   The meeting drew an audience of 99 people, the lowest since GM
began recording attendance in 1948. The largest was 5,739 at a 1964
meeting, also in Wilmington, where the company is incorporated.
	   GM shares rose 5/8 to 58 1/4 in midafternoon trading.
