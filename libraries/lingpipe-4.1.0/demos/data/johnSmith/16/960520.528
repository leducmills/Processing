	   (Adds reaction from GM in paragraphs 14-17)
	   Washington, May 20 (Bloomberg) -- President Bill Clinton said
today he's renewing for another year China's most favored nation
trading status with the U.S.
	   The move will draw strong opposition in Congress, although even
opponents say they lack enough votes to block the president's MFN
decision.
	   ``Today China stands at a critical crossroads,'' Clinton said in
a speech at the Pacific Basin Economic Council meeting in
Washington. ``Revoking MFN, in effect revoking our economic ties
with China, would drive us back to a period of mutual isolation and
recrimination that would harm America's interests, not advance
them.''
	   Countries granted the MFN privilege may export goods to the U.S.
at the lowest tariff rates. The special trading status is extended
for most countries on an annual basis with little fanfare.
	   Nothing comes that simply when China is involved, however. For
example, the U.S. recently threatened and then declined to impose
trade sanctions for China's sale of nuclear weapons components to
Pakistan. Three days later, the administration threatened punitive
tariffs on as much as $3 billion in Chinese exports, saying the
Beijing government hasn't lived up to an agreement to halt piracy
of U.S. entertainment and computer software.
	   China responded by saying it will retaliate with 100 percent
tariffs of its own on a broad range of U.S. products if the U.S.
goes through with its trade threat.
	   ``MFN renewal is not a referendum on all China's policies,''
Clinton said. ``It is a vote for America's interests. This is a
long-term endeavor and we must be steady and firm. We cannot walk
backward into the future. We will engage with China without
illusion to advance our interests in a more peaceful, prosperous
world.''
	   American companies with business ventures in China have long
called for permanent MFN for China. They say the annual debate over
China's MFN renewal further strains relations and impedes business
ties.
	   U.S. athletic footwear manufacturer Nike -- which makes 30
percent of its athletic footwear in China -- welcomed today's
announcement.
	   ``We are delighted and relieved that MFN was renewed for China
once again,'' said Nike spokeswoman Donna Gibbs. ``We'd rather not
have to go through this every year, but we're encouraged by signs
the president believes it's better to engage in trade with China
rather than simply close the door.
	   Boeing Co. also welcomed the news.
	   ``We're very pleased and we hope this helps lead to full
normalization of commercial relations with China in the future,''
said a company spokesman Chris Villiers.
	   Boeing is a long-time advocate of permanent MFN status for
China. Boeing, with a 70 percent share of China's commercial
aircraft market, has much to lose in a trade war with China.
Already, the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer is feeling the
heat as China signed a deal in March to buy $1.5 billion worth of
airliners from European manufacturer Airbus Industrie.
	   General Motors Chairman and CEO John Smith also called on the
U.S. to grant permanent MFN for China.
	   ``China is looking for signs that we accept it as a major
emerging power,'' Smith said in a statement.
	   Smith said it was difficult for American companies to make
long-range plans for the China market with threats of cancellation
of China's MFN status in the air. In the past few years, GM opened
assembly plants in Taiwan, India and Indonesia. ``China, beyond all
others, expands the vision and the possibilities of the future.''
	   The National Association of Manufacturers hailed Clinton's
``leadership on China MFN,'' and said it would work to make sure
MFN has sufficient backing in Congress.
	   ``New opportunities to increase economic growth, exports and
create jobs will be realized when renewal of MFN for China becomes
official,'' said NAM president Jerry Jasinowski. The National
Retail Federation, which represents companies such as J.C. Penney
Co. and WalMart, also applauded the move, calling it a ``positive
step.''
	   However, NRF President Tracy Mullin said she's concerned about
the impact of trade sanctions threatened last week on Chinese made
clothing and consumer electronics in a separate dispute over piracy
of U.S. software and sound and video recordings.
	   ``China MFN is meaningless for millions of low and middle income
American families as long as 100 percent tariffs are set to begin
in 30 days on clothing and electronics,'' Mullin said. Not every
industry group favors according China trading privileges. The
American Textile Manufacturers Institute said Clinton should have
denied MFN to China because of continued piracy of American
products.
	   ``We believe that the U.S. should not renew MFN...China has
repeatedly violated its bilateral textile agreement, kept its
market closed to our products, engaged in import fraud,
counterfeited our copyrighted textile designs and trademarks and
illegally transshipped between $2-and-$4 billion worth of textiles
and apparel each year,'' said ATMI President James Fitzgibbons.
	   Last year, China exported $45 billion worth of goods and
services to America while the U.S. sold a mere $11 billion. The
U.S.-China trade deficit for the first three months of 1996 is 7
percent higher than for the same period last year at $6.99 billion.
	   Although today's presidential announcement was widely expected,
the timing is a bit of a surprise. In past years, Clinton and
President George Bush waited until the last minute to make their
decisions public.
	   This time, administration officials went out of their way to
signal the president would extend China's MFN when it expires on
June 3. And congressional supporters of MFN renewal for China asked
Clinton to send a clear early message. ``We expect opposition so
we're building a public case,'' said White House spokesman Mike
McCurry.
	   Opponents of MFN in Congress argue that China's continued human
rights abuses, its recent intimidation of Taiwan and failure to
abide by trade agreements are reasons to take away the trade
privileges.
	   After he sends Congress his formal decision on June 3, Congress
has 60 days to reject it. Such a symbolic vote could pass in the
House and Senate as well. Even so, even MFN opponents say there
aren't sufficient votes in either chamber to override a Clinton
veto.
	   The presumptive Republican nominee for president, Sen. Robert
Dole of Kansas, has already said MFN should be renewed for China.
	   Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, one of two senators
vying to replace Dole as majority leader, said he is sure the
Senate will back renewal. ``We should do what we can to expand
trade between both countries,'' Cochran said during an interview on
CNBC. ``I think the Senate will go for'' renewing MFN for China.
