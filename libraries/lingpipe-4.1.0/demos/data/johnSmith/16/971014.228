	   Detroit, Oct. 14 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s
third-quarter profit rose 4.8 percent, beating expectations, as
cost cuts fueled a big improvement in its North American car and
truck business that offset weakness overseas.
	   The world's largest automaker said net income rose to $1.07
billion, or $1.35 a share, from profit from operations of $1.02
billion, or $1.23, in the year-earlier period. GM was expected to
earn $1.21 a share, the average estimate of 13 analysts by IBES
International Inc.
	   GM said profit in North America soared to $423 million from $24
million, excluding a gain in the year-earlier period, helping to
make the latest period GM's best third quarter ever in profit
before any special gains.
	   ``The surprise is that North American operations did much better
than expected,'' said David Bradley, a J.P. Morgan analyst. GM's
Delphi parts business did worse than expected, however, Bradley
said.
	   GM shares fell 1 3/16 to 70 1/4 in midday trading. The
automaker's shares hit a 52-week high of 71 11/16 yesterday.
	   The increase in North America was important because GM lost $21
million in Europe, where carmakers are battling overcapacity with
steep price cuts. Combined earnings in Latin America and the Asia
Pacific region fell to $158 million from $248 million. Revenue rose
7.2 percent to $41.89 billion from $39.08 billion.
	   After a gain of $253 million, or 34 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period for changes in its plant-closing fund, the
company reported net income of $1.27 billion, or $1.57 a share.
There were no gains or charges in the recent quarter.
	   The company introduced 14 new or redesigned domestic cars and
trucks that cut production costs as much as 30 percent by using
fewer parts than the vehicles they replaced. GM's North American
automotive employment also fell 2.6 percent from the year-earlier
quarter to 414,000.
	   ``By continuing to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, GM's
North American operations scored significant improvements in
financial performance, even with relatively comparable sales
volume,'' John Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement.
	   The company is upbeat about the outlook of the North American
auto industry. ``I think the environment in general is going to be
pretty favorable,'' said Chief Financial Officer J. Michael Losh.
It's different in Europe, he said, which will remain ``a
slow-growth market.''
	   GM's North American brands include Chevrolet, Saturn, GMC and
Pontiac. Its European, Asian and Latin American brands include
Opel, Holden and Vauxhall.
	   The company's worldwide factory sales rose 6.0 percent to 2.12
million, helped by better availability of new minivans, the
Chevrolet Malibu and other models in North America. Its worldwide
market share rose to 16.6 percent from 16.1 percent.
	   GM's year-earlier earnings were helped by an unusually low tax
rate of 2.9 percent. GM's tax rate was 27.7 percent in the
just-completed quarter, lower than the anticipated 34 percent but
still much higher than in the 1996 period. The
more-favorable-than-expected rate added 9 cents a share to the most
recent earnings report, analysts said.
	   The automaker's retail incentives in North America rose to $992
a vehicle in the quarter from $764 in the year-earlier period.
Incentives in Europe rose to $637 per vehicle from $556.
	   Losh said GM's incentives in the fourth quarter should be lower
than the third quarter.
	   Among other GM units, earnings at the partsmaker Delphi
Automotive Systems fell 77 percent, more than expected, to $55
million, in part because of intense price competition among
automotive suppliers.
	   ``The pressure is not going to go away,'' said Losh, while
adding that it was more ``magnified'' in the third quarter than it
will be in the future.
	   GM is expected to sell a stake in Delphi as early as next year.
	   GM's financial arm General Motors Acceptance Corp. saw profits
increase 1.6 percent to $240 million.
	   The Hughes Electronics subsidiary said yesterday earnings fell
4.8 percent to $240 million, mostly because of lower profits at its
automotive electronics business, Delco Electronics.
