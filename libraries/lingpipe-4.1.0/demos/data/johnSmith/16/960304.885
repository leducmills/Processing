
	   DETROIT , After months of dismissing concerns that its cars have
become too expensive, Ford Motor Co. has reversed course and begun
an aggressive cost-cutting campaign that includes the elimination
of 6,000 product engineering jobs.
	   Ford officials said Monday that the company planned to reduce
its product development staff to 23,000 from 29,000 over the next
several years, mainly by reducing the number of engineers who are
hired on long-term contracts but are not on the company's permanent
payroll, the officials said.
	   Some of the shrinkage in staff will also come through
retirements, possibly including an early retirement program, and by
not replacing people who leave.
	   Chris Vinyard, a company spokesman, confirmed that Ford would be
reducing its product development staff but said that, ``we don't
contemplate anything that would be characterized as a layoff'' for
career Ford employees.
	   The cutbacks at Ford are part of a broader shift in attitude
among Detroit automakers. After years of pushing up car and truck
prices faster than inflation, they have decided that the
affordability of their products has become a problem, and are
taking a wide range of steps to correct it.
	   That new consensus in the Motor City is good news for car
buyers, but could jeopardize auto industry jobs.
	   The shift is most evident at Ford, whose chairman publicly
dismissed affordability concerns just two months ago. But
executives at Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. have also
been taking numerous steps to reduce costs.
	   ``You've got to be conscious of what you're putting on the
car,'' said John Smith Jr., the chairman and chief executive of
General Motors.
	   Ford has gone the farthest in the last several weeks in
releasing details of its cost-cutting plans in an effort to address
concerns on Wall Street. The company's latest steps include:
 No longer painting the insides of the ashtrays on the
Explorer, for a savings of 25 cents on each of the sport utility
vehicles.
 Using a single carpet fabric for its car trunks instead of
seven fabrics, for a savings of 90 cents a car.
 Using a single cigarette lighter instead of 14 different
lighters on various models, for a saving of 16 cents a vehicle.
	   All of these cost-saving steps sound small. And for any given
vehicle, they are. The unpainted Explorer ashtrays shave just 25
cents from the production cost of a sport utility vehicle that
sells for close to $30,000. But with the Explorer ranking as the
nation's third-best selling vehicle, the paint savings on ashtrays
add up to $99,000 a year.
