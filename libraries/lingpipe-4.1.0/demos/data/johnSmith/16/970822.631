
	   DETROIT , Think of it as a midlife crisis. At age 50, Saab finds
itself at a crossroads: After years of struggling, it has a new
management team, a new advertising agency and perhaps most
important, a new car on the way.
	   Next month, in the most visible of all the internal shifts at
the company, Saab embarks on a new advertising campaign as it
struggles to jettison its murky image.
	   ``For them, image is going to be critical,'' said Christopher
Cedergren, managing director of Nextrend, a Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
auto research group. ``Because the Saab image is so nebulous right
now, it is really going to be difficult for them to compete against
Mercedes and BMW.''
	   Saab has a plan. The campaign, created by Saab's new advertising
agency, the Martin Agency of Richmond, Va., part of Interpublic
Group of Cos., aims to reposition the cars as safe,
high-performance autos that are fun to drive.
	   ``We're presenting Saab as a car that offers the safety of a
Volvo without the boredom, and the performance of a BMW without the
pretense,'' John B. Adams Jr., Martin's chairman and chief
executive, said.
	   The campaign consists of four print advertisements that will
appear in the October issues of magazines like Forbes, Food and
Wine and Vanity Fair and two 30-second television ads that will be
shown, starting Sept. 8, on shows like ``Seinfeld,'' ``The Tonight
Show'' and ``20/20.''
	   The print ads have dark backgrounds with quirky, diagonal
photographs of the car to convey a sense of motion. One carries a
headline reading, ``Safety marries performance. They elope.'' The
text describes how driving a Saab feels safe because of the car's
turbocharged engine and tight handling. A television ad shows a
couple riding down the highway in a convertible as an ominous
shadow cast by the setting sun nearly overtakes the car. The driver
accelerates, sending the car speeding into the sunshine on the road
ahead.
	   While the new ads showcase the Saab 900, the smaller of Saab's
two models, Adams said the advertisements would reposition the
whole Saab brand, which has been struggling. Saab doubled its
annual ad budget in 1996 to $62 million, according to Competitive
Media Reporting, which tracks advertising spending. With the new ad
campaign and the new car, Saab plans to increase its ad spending
next year to about $70 million.
	   Saab's larger car, the 9000 model, will be replaced in April
with a sedan called the 9-5, followed with a station wagon in late
1998.
	   Saab executives have pinned their hopes on the new sedan because
it has been so long since the company has introduced a new model.
The Saab 9000 has changed little since its debut in 1986. Even the
Saab 900 has been around since 1978, although it was substantially
redesigned in 1993.
	   Saab's popularity reached its peak in the mid-1980s, but sales
then began to slide, bottoming out in 1993. Profits fell, too. In
this decade, Saab has lost money every year except 1994 and 1995.
Executives have said they expect Saab to return to profitability in
1999.

	   For all those years, Saab's owners have been bailing it out
while wondering whether they were throwing good money after bad.
Saab Automobile AB is a joint venture between Investor AB, an
investment group controlled by the Wallenberg family of Sweden, and
General Motors Corp.
	   Last summer, Investor seemed to lose patience. It reached a deal
with GM that gives Investor the right to force GM to take an
additional 25 percent stake in the company in 2000 and gives GM the
option of buying Investor's entire stake then. Saab executives have
said they hope to improve the company enough by then to make it
worth arguing over.
	   The next 12 to 18 months are ``the most important in the last
decade'' for Saab, David Garrity, an analyst at Smith Barney, said.
``The clock is ticking between now and the year 2000.''
	   Fixing Saab has been harder than executives thought, with sales
goals slipping again and again, only to be reset at lower levels.
In 1990, when Saab sold 93,224 cars worldwide, its goal was to sell
180,000 by the year 2000. By last year, when it sold 98,036
worldwide, it hoped to sell 150,000 cars by 2000, 40,000 of them in
the United States. This year, it expects sales in this country to
top 30,000.
	   As GM has increased its investment in Saab, it has devoted more
management attention to it. Last summer, it named Robert Hendry,
51, a GM executive close to John Smith Jr., GM's chairman, as chief
executive of Saab. It also brought two executives from GM's highly
regarded Saturn division to Saab's American arm.
	   John Orth, a former Saturn executive who serves as Saab Cars USA
Inc.'s vice president for sales and marketing, said Saab planned to
improve its sales and customer service while quietly taking
advantage of economies of scale available through its link to GM.
	   Since 62 percent of Saab's sales are in the Northeast, Orth
wants to persuade buyers in other parts of the country to choose
Saabs. In addition, he is bringing to Saab dealers some lessons
learned at Saturn, which has a reputation for strong customer
relations.
	   A handful of Saab dealers are likely to sign up soon to try the
no-haggle pricing used by Saturn dealers, and Orth said he hoped
more would try it.
	   While Saab plans to continue to keep its distance from GM when
it comes to designing cars, Orth said the ties to the giant company
had already helped it keep costs down.
	   For instance, the Saab 9-5 shares its underpinnings with GM's
Opel cars in Europe, cutting development costs. Also, by using GM's
corporate might, Saab was able to get more bang for its buck in
advertising. ``We've basically gotten 25 to 30 percent more ads
than we would have gotten if we'd run the campaigns by ourselves,''
he said.
	   But all the changes ride on the shoulders of the Saab 9-5.
``Saab is going to put a full-court press on'' with the new
advertising, Cedergren, the auto consultant, said. ``They really
view that car as being the primary catalyst for the rebirth.''
