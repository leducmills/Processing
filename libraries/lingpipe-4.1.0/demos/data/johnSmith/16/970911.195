	   Frankfurt, Sept. 11 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. and European carmakers
said they are unfazed by Southeast Asia's recent economic slowdown
and will continue to plan billions of dollars of investments in the
region.
	   ``It is still a growth market and we want to be there,'' said
Daimler-Benz AG management board member Juergen Hubbert, who is
responsible for its Mercedes-Benz passenger car division.
	   Southeast Asia's economic expansion is not as fast as previously
expected, with economies in countries such as Thailand and
Indonesia growing at their lowest rates for more than a decade,
according to official figures.
	   Western carmakers, though, are plagued by near flat demand in
saturated domestic markets and are keen to take advantage of the
growing wealth of the ``tiger'' economies. Auto executives argue
that the Asian slowdown was to be expected and the economies will
pick up again, generating higher average growth rates than markets
in Europe and the U.S.
	   ``We are estimating an average 7.5 percent growth in Asian
economies by the year 2000 and 15 percent in China alone so that is
still a lot more than in Europe,'' said Sebastian Stein, an auto
industry analyst at Bankgesellschaft Berlin AG.
	   Mercedes is currently considering large investments in Asia,
including a $1 billion minivan joint venture in China and buying a
majority stake in Korean carmaker Ssangyong Motor Corp., in a bid
to achieve its goal of increasing its Asian sales to 25 percent of
the group's total revenue, up from 8 percent at the moment.
	   Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said it's considering increasing its
presence in the region by building a plant, possibly in Indonesia
or Thailand, though it has said it will monitor economic
developments closely.
	   Carmakers are revising down sales forecasts in Asia. Toyota
Motor Corp., the world's third-largest automaker, said last month
sales in member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), especially Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia
and Thailand could fall 20 percent to 30 percent this year.
	   ``You have to look at the long term average growth rate over
ten, fifteen years,'' said BMW management board member Wolfgang
Reitzle. ``A decision to establish a plant is a decision for
twenty, thirty years or more.''
	   Investing in a production site in a Southeast Asian country has
the double benefit of avoiding many of the hefty import duties and
gaining greater acceptance in the local market. At the same time
selling cars in many of these countries is often not possible
without forming a joint venture with a local company or government
agency.
	   The increase in production capacity has caused concern in the
industry, with many factories in Europe and the U.S. running below
full capacity and still producing more cars than are sold. In 1996,
some 55 million cars were made, about 3.2 million more than were
sold in the same period, according to a survey of industry analysts
by Automotive News Europe.
	   ``Although you should not go building up capacity just like
that, it is important to have a foot in the door,'' said Stein.
	   Much of the investment planned for the Asian region is being
directed towards China, a market touted as being potentially one of
the world's largest car markets.
	   General Motors Corp. is among the biggest backers of China's car
market. It's building a $1.57 billion car plant, and would like to
build another, said GM Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr.
	   ``China, more than anywhere else, is the place we'd like to do
other things,'' said Smith.
	   Other large investors in China, include Volkswagen AG, which has
been present in the market for more than 12 years, growing to one
of the few profitable foreign carmakers in the country, with a more
than 50 percent market share.
	   ``Our main focus in Asia is China, and that's because of its
political makeup has special economic conditions,,'' said Bruno
Adelt, chief financial officer at Volkswagen.
	   The company earlier this year said it will invest a further 200
million deutsche marks ($112 million) in a new test site in China
for its Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Co. joint venture. About 70
percent of the German carmaker's sales in the Asian region are
outside China.
	   ``I am a little bit concerned about big investments in China,''
said Ulrich Huwald, an auto analyst at Hamburgische Landesbank.
``The rewards may not be as high as everyone expects.''
	   Huwald is not the only skeptic. Chrysler Corp. Vice Chairman
Robert Lutz says the company has been careful about investing in
Asia. ``We weren't carried away by the hype,'' he said. Chrysler
has ``the contrarian philosophy.''
	   The U.S. company said in July it was closing its Beijing office
because of limited opportunities to expand in the market.
	   Chrysler has a joint venture in China, Beijing Jeep, that makes
Jeep Cherokees and other Jeeps.
	   The Bejing Jeep joint venture ``is chugging along,'' and
Chrysler makes money only on the parts it sells the plant, said
Lutz. India, China and Vietnam all are places Chrysler has
approached with caution, he said.
	   ``We're having more and more people come up to us and say, `How
were you guys so smart?''' Lutz said.
