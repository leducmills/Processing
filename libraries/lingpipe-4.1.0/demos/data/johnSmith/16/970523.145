	   Wilmington, Delaware, May 23 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.
won't accept any strike settlements that damage the company's
financial health, Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith said.
	   ``We must make General Motors competitive and avoid settlements
that damage us for the long term,'' Smith said at the company's
annual shareholders meeting in Wilmington, Delaware.
	   He added that building constructive relationships with its
unions is as ``much a part of our future as competitiveness.''
	   The United Auto Workers union went on strike last month at GM's
Oklahoma City and Pontiac, Michigan, assembly plants. Little
progress has been reported.
	   Smith also said the company wants to boost its international
sales to 5 million vehicles a year by 2006 from last year's 3
million.
	   The company's move to consolidate its worldwide parts purchasing
business saved $150 million last quarter, Smith said.
