	   Chicago, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s Chairman
John Smith Jr. said the yen has stabilized and the yen-dollar
relationship won't have a greater impact on GM's second-quarter
earnings than it did on the first.
	   ``Our judgment is the yen will not continue to decline,'' Smith
said after a speech in Chicago.
	   The relative strength of the dollar versus the yen has given
Japanese automakers a pricing edge in the U.S. because the dollars
produce more yen when they are converted into the Japanese
currency.
	   Smith said the strong dollar has increased competitive pressure
from Japanese automakers, but ``we're on track to improve our
market share.''
	   Smith said he thinks the U.S. auto market remains ``very
strong.''
	   A continuing United Auto Workers strike at a GM car plant in
Oklahoma City will hurt product availability more than GM's profit,
he said.
