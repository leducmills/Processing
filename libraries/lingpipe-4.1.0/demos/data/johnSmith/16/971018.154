
	   The AT&T Corp. plans to wrap up its three-month search for a new
chairman and chief executive on Monday by tapping C. Michael
Armstrong, the head of the Hughes Electronics Corp., for at least
one of the high-profile posts, according to executives close to the
situation.
	   The executives said that Michael Smith, vice chairman of Hughes,
would replace Armstrong as chairman and chief executive of Hughes.
Smith is a brother of John Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive
of Hughes' corporate parent, the General Motors Corp.
	   AT&T and Hughes declined to comment, and Armstrong could not be
reached Saturday.
	   Word of Armstrong's impending appointment at AT&T was first
reported late Friday by CNBC, the cable television channel, after
major financial markets closed.
	   AT&T, the nation's largest telecommunications company with 1996
sales of $52.2 billion, is known to have been negotiating with
Armstrong for months as the company looked for a successor to
Robert Allen, AT&T's current chairman and chief executive.
	   The search has taken on particular urgency in recent weeks as a
wave of massive takeover bids has roiled the fast-growing
telecommunications industry.
	   The MCI Communications Corp., the No. 2 long-distance company
and AT&T's biggest rival, is being pursued as an acquisition target
by at least three large suitors , British Telecommunications PLC,
the GTE Corp. and Worldcom Inc. , with bids of between $19 billion
and $30 billion.
	   AT&T has appeared to be somewhat on the telecommunications
sidelines since its merger talks fell apart earlier this year with
SBC Communications Inc., one of the regional Bell companies, amid
confusion between the two sides and strong denunciations from the
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Reed Hundt.
	   And even though the company's stock has performed well in recent
months as AT&T has shown signs that it may be slowing its
market-share erosion in its core long-distance business, it has yet
to unveil a comprehensive strategy for expanding into the lucrative
local telephone market.
	   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 eased many of the regulations
that since the mid-1980s had prevented local and long-distance
telephone companies from entering each other's markets, and
telecommunications companies of all sizes are jockeying to offer a
full bundle of communications services under a single brand
umbrella.
	   But it was the aborted talks with SBC that helped hasten the
departure from AT&T of the last man who was meant to assume the
company's top jobs. John Walter, who had run R.R. Donnelly and Sons
Co., a large commercial publisher, was hand-picked by Allen to be
his successor late last year. At the time Armstrong had been on a
short list of candidates for the job Walter eventually won.
	   Walter left the company this summer in the wake of the SBC
debacle, after Allen said he had concluded that his erstwhile
protege lacked the intellectual leadership to run the company.
	   AT&T's leading internal candidate to replace Allen has been the
vice chairman, John Zeglis, 50. On Friday, AT&T's board gave Zeglis
the added titles of president and chief operating officer, news
agencies reported. That move would be meant to keep Zeglis at the
company even if Armstrong, who is 59, were hired for the top job.
	   Armstrong's leadership qualities are well known in the
technology field. A former senior executive at IBM, Armstrong since
1992 has changed Hughes from a lumbering commercial electronics
operation into a fast-growing unit that has made digital satellite
television systems its flagship product line.
	   AT&T's shares gained $1.625 on Friday, closing at $45.1875.
