
	   NEW YORK , Wandering the Kia or Hyundai showrooms at the Plaza
Auto Mall in Brooklyn, a potential buyer sees no signs that the
Korean auto industry is being shaken to its foundations. Sales in
the United States are growing and so are cash payments from
manufacturers to dealers to pump up sales.
	   ``You can get up to $3,000 off a Kia Sephia, which makes it
about the most affordable car in America, for around $8,000,'' said
John Bruno, vice president and general manager of Plaza, which is
in Brooklyn's Midwood section.
	   But it may not be long before American car shoppers start seeing
some effects from the Korean financial crisis. Last week, Hyundai
Motor Co. dismissed 31 people, or 7 percent of the staff, at its
American headquarters in California, including the vice president
of product planning.
	   Daewoo Corp., South Korea's third-largest automaker, canceled
its plans for an American debut next week at the Greater Los
Angeles Auto Show, stirring speculation that the company will again
postpone its entry , for the sixth time , into the U.S. market. And
then there is Kia , bankrupt, under control of the Korean
government and a likely takeover target.
	   The crisis that has consumed the South Korea economy has caused
turmoil at most of the nation's leading companies, and the four
domestic automakers are no exception. With thousands of Koreans
suddenly out of work and interest rates soaring, the country's auto
sales are expected to drop 10 percent next year. The auto industry,
already burdened by excess capacity at its plants, is staggering
under the weight of huge loans.
	   ``This is going to put them years behind where they wanted to
be,'' said Michael Schmall, managing partner for the Planning Edge,
a firm in Troy, Mich., that does consulting for auto companies.
	   The Korean automakers, while still a relatively small force in
the United States, had grand plans of becoming big global
competitors. Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia and Samsung all borrowed heavily
over the last 10 years to expand production and turn South Korea
into the world's fourth-largest automobile market, behind North
America, Western Europe and Japan.
	   Corporate bravado and government subsidies built a national auto
industry with three times as much plant capacity as the country
needs. Today, the Koreans are capable of building more than four
million cars and trucks a year, while domestic demand can sop up
only 1.6 million vehicles. In 1996, Korean car exports totaled just
1.1 million.
	   ``They never realized there would be a downturn,'' said Richard
Pyo, an auto industry analyst in Seoul for Credit Suisse First
Boston. ``Now we're sitting on huge capacity and not enough
domestic demand.''
	   With Korean sales sagging and plants running at 80 percent of
capacity, the automakers are finding it harder and harder to pay
interest on their loans. Eight industrial conglomerates, including
Kia, have collapsed; the Korean currency has lost half its value,
and the government is seeking the largest international bailout in
history.

	   So risky is the financial health of Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung
that on Monday Moody's Investors Service lowered their credit
ratings to junk-bond status, making it difficult and expensive for
them to borrow more.
	   The weakness of the Korean automakers and parts suppliers has
started a wave of mergers and acquisitions. Among the first deals,
Daewoo snapped up Ssangyong Motor Co. (pronounced sang-YOUNG), a
deeply indebted maker of sport utility vehicles.
	   Last week, John Smith Jr., chairman of General Motors Corp.,
told a small group of shareholders that he expected only Hyundai
and Daewoo to survive, leaving Kia and Samsung to collapse or be
sold. Smith said he had sent a team to Korea to scout for ailing
auto parts companies to buy.
	   Ford Motor Co. is also watching Korean developments closely,
partly because Ford and its Japanese affiliate, Mazda Motor Corp.,
already own about 15 percent of Kia. Ford's chairman, Alexander
Trotman, said recently that he was interested in increasing Ford's
stake. But some industry analysts say the Korean government is
unlikely to give Ford or any other foreign company control over an
automaker. Instead, these analysts speculate that Kia will
eventually be sold to Samsung.
	   By acquiring Korean automakers, American companies may be able
to gain better access to the highly protected Korean market, and
build cars with cheaper parts. The Clinton administration is also
trying to force the Korean government to open its borders to
American products by tacking free-trade conditions to its share of
the International Monetary Fund's $57 billion loan package.
	   ``Obviously, we want them to open their markets,'' said Andrew
Card Jr., president of the American Automobile Manufacturers
Association, a lobbying group for U.S. car makers. Card asked the
Clinton administration last summer to impose sanctions on South
Korea for failing to comply with an automotive trade agreement
signed by the two countries in 1995. ``They should comply with that
agreement whether there's an IMF loan or not,'' Card said.
	   The fall in the value of the won, however, has worsened the
situation by making imports from the United States more expensive.
Last month, Ford, GM and Chrysler sold a total of just 268 vehicles
in Korea, their worst showing in a year.
	   But for American consumers, the crisis may provide some good
news. Trade officials are bracing for a flood of cheaper Hyundai
Accents and Sonatas and Kia Sephias. Kia's U.S. sales jumped 74
percent in November, and Hyundai's rose 4 percent from a year
earlier. While both companies say they have no plans to cut prices
immediately, they are giving dealers larger incentives to help sell
more vehicles.
	   ``Kia's operations in America are crucial to the success of Kia
Motors Corp.,'' said Geno Effler, a spokesman for Kia's American
subsidiary, which is based in Irvine, Calif. ``Right now we account
for 25 percent of their exports. We are the No. 1 export market for
Kia. I think there's a lot of room for us to grow.''
