	   Chicago, May 30 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. manufacturing activity
continued to expand in the Midwest during May, though at a slower
pace than it did in April, while prices rose, the Purchasing
Management Association of Chicago said.
	   The group's monthly index of regional manufacturing activity
fell to 56.8 in May from 57.2 in April. Before today's report,
analysts expected the index to fall to 56.9 in May. An index above
50 means manufacturers reporting improved business outnumbered
those reporting deteriorating conditions.
	   As Midwestern manufacturers continued to pump out goods, prices
rose. The association's index of prices paid rose to 56.9 in May
from 53.3 in April. That's a sign that inflationary pressures may
be building in the Midwest.
	   ``The economy is going to start to pick up steam again, and the
Federal Reserve will be forced to move,'' said Rick Egelton, deputy
chief economist at Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal, before today's
report.
	   Within the components of the manufacturing index, the production
index fell to 58.7 from 61.1, while the inventory index fell to
47.1 from 49.7, the association said. Meantime, the group's
employment index fell to 53.6 from 56.1, suggesting the job market
worsened in the region.
	   The new orders index, a gauge of future business activity, fell
to 58.4 from 61.6.
	   The overall index ``continues to show economic growth'' the
Chicago Purchasing Management Association said.
	   In the minutes after release of today's regional survey the
benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 11/32, pushing down its
its yield 3 basis points to 6.94 percent.
	   Investors and economists pay attention to the outlook for growth
because of concerns the economy is operating close to full
capacity, raising the risk of accelerating inflation. Indeed, in a
statement explaining March's quarter-point boost in overnight
borrowing costs for banks to 5.50 percent, the Federal Reserve
cited ``persisting strength in demand.''
	   This morning, the government revised its estimate of growth
during the first quarter to 5.8 percent from the previous estimate
of 5.6 percent and said inflation remained under wraps. Rising
exports and consumer spending drove the economy in the first
quarter. If demand remains strong, manufacturers will have to
increase production.
	   Some Midwestern manufacturers do expect demand to continue.
Moline, Illinois-based Deere & Co. said earlier this month it
expects its total sales to dealers in units to rise by 8 percent
this year from 1996. The company, which makes agricultural,
construction and lawn equipment, previously said it expected a 6
percent increase.
	   ``The remainder of 1997 should benefit from a growing global
economy, healthy agricultural markets and generally high levels of
farmer confidence,'' Deere Chief Executive Hans Becherer said.
	   Still, U.S. automakers have said they don't expect to meet all
their sales targets. General Motors Corp. won't reach its goal of
boosting its U.S. market share to 33 percent this year because
strikes have crippled production, GM Chairman and Chief Executive
John Smith Jr. said yesterday.
	   And Ford Motor Co. has seen its North American car production
fall by a third since 1987, to an estimated 1.5 million this year.
	   While today's purchasing managers report only measures activity
in the Chicago area, investors watch it for a preview of the
National Association of Purchasing Management's index, which
measures conditions nationwide. The NAPM report is scheduled for
release Monday at 10 a.m. Washington time, and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News expect the index to fall to 53.6 from 55.0 last
month.
	   Yesterday, the New York chapter of the NAPM reported business
activity in its region continued to expand in May, though growth
was more sluggish than it had been in prior months. The New York's
NAPM's index fell to 50.8 percent in May from April's 50.9 percent.
	   At the same time, the New York purchasing managers said prices
they paid in May were ``largely steady.'' The prices paid index
rose to 51 percent this month from a reading of 49 percent in
April.
