	   Detroit, Oct. 14 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.'s
third-quarter earnings rose 4.8 percent as a low tax rate and
cost-cutting in North America offset poor performances in Europe
and the Delphi auto-parts business.
	   The world's largest automaker's earnings rose to $1.07 billion,
or $1.35 a fully diluted share, from $1.02 billion, or $1.23,
before a gain in the year-earlier period. That beat expectations of
$1.21 a share, the average estimate of 13 analysts by IBES
International Inc.
	   Investors focused on a 77 percent profit decline at GM's Delphi
Automotive Systems, some analysts said, and GM shares fell 1 5/16
to 70 1/8 in late trading. Delphi's weaker-than-expected results
dimmed hopes that an initial public offering could come in the
first half of 1998.
	   ``It seems like with that lack of profitability we're further
away from a Delphi initial public offering than we thought we
were,'' said Nicholas Colas, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst.
	   Other analysts said GM's stock price declined as investors
dismissed the impact of a lower-than-expected tax rate of 27.7
percent. Without that help, earnings would have been 9 cents lower,
closer to the IBES average and disappointing the more bullish
observers. GM stock had risen 6.7 percent this month through
yesterday, when it hit a 52-week high of 71 11/16.
	   Profit fell at Delphi because, like other parts suppliers, it
had to offer steep cuts to land new business, GM Chief Financial
Officer J. Michael Losh said. Earnings at Delphi, the world's
largest partsmaker, fell to $55 million from $238 million.
	   ``The pressure is not going to go away,'' Losh said.
	   The performance was GM's best third quarter ever. Revenue rose
7.2 percent to $41.89 billion.
	   GM's North America car and truck earnings were $423 million,
nearly 17 times the $24 million earned before the gain the
year-ago, because the automaker is running its plants more
efficiently and cutting its parts, materials and engineering costs.
	   ``The surprise is that North American operations did much better
than expected,'' said David Bradley, a J.P. Morgan analyst.
	   The increase in North America was important because GM lost $21
million in Europe, where carmakers are battling overcapacity with
steep price cuts, compared with earnings of $75 million in the
year-earlier quarter. Combined earnings in Latin America and the
Asia Pacific region fell 37 percent to $158 million.
	   After a gain of $253 million, or 34 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period for changes in a plant-closing fund, GM
reported net income of $1.27 billion, or $1.57 a share. There were
no gains or charges in the recent quarter.
	   GM's year-earlier earnings were helped by an unusually low tax
rate of 2.9 percent. The rate of 27.7 percent in the just-completed
quarter was lower than the projected 34 percent.
	   The company introduced 14 new or redesigned domestic cars and
trucks that cut production costs as much as 30 percent by using
fewer parts than the vehicles they replaced. GM's North American
automotive employment also fell 2.6 percent from the year-earlier
quarter to 414,000.
	   ``By continuing to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, GM's
North American operations scored significant improvements in
financial performance, even with relatively comparable sales
volume,'' John Smith Jr., chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement.
	   The company is upbeat about the outlook of the North American
auto industry.
	   ``I think the environment in general is going to be pretty
favorable,'' said Losh. It's different in Europe, he said, which
will remain ``a slow-growth market.''
	   GM's North American brands include Chevrolet, Saturn, GMC and
Pontiac. Its European, Asian and Latin American brands include
Opel, Holden and Vauxhall.
	   The company's worldwide factory sales rose 6.0 percent to 2.12
million, helped by better availability of new minivans, the
Chevrolet Malibu and other models in North America. Its worldwide
market share rose to 16.6 percent from 16.1 percent.
	   The automaker's retail incentives in North America rose to $992
a vehicle in the quarter from $764 in the year-earlier period.
Incentives in Europe rose to $637 per vehicle from $556.
	   Losh said GM's incentives in the fourth quarter should be lower
than the third quarter. GM's financial arm General Motors
Acceptance Corp. saw profits increase 1.6 percent to $240 million.
The Hughes Electronics subsidiary said yesterday earnings fell 4.8
percent to $240 million, mostly because of lower profits at its
automotive electronics business, Delco Electronics.
	   Delco and Delphi will merge following the $10 billion sale of
GM's Hughes defense business to Raytheon Co., which shareholders
will be asked to approve next month. Today's GM report follows
Chrysler's last week. Chrysler earnings fell 37 percent to $466
million, or 69 cents a share. Ford Motor Co. will report earnings
tomorrow. Even with GM's share decline today, some investors remain
bullish on the automaker.
	   ``It's a well-run company that continues to improve,'' said
Robert Olstein, who manages $220 million for Olstein and Associates
in Purchase, N.Y. ``We think it's worth somewhere between $80 and
$90 a share.
