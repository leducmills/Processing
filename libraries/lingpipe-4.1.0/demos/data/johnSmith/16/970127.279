	   Detroit, Jan. 27, 1997 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp.
increased dividends on two classes of its common stock and approved
a $2.5 billion share repurchase program for its mostly widely held
stock.
	   GM increased the dividend on its $1 2/3 common stock to 50 cents
a share from 40 cents, payable March 10 to holders of record Feb.
6. The automaker said it will rebuy $2.5 billion, or about 5
percent, of the outstanding shares of the common stock during the
next 12 months and will consider buying more.
	   Analysts have been speculating about the dividend hike for
months, citing GM's growing cash reserves. Some analysts expected
the dividend to rise to 60 cents and the program to repurchase as
much as $3 billion in stock.
	   GM shares fell 2 to 60 1/2 in late morning trading.
	   The moves are designed to return ``capital to shareholders in a
manner which is sustainable throughout the business cycle,''
Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith Jr. said.
	   GM's cash balance grew to $17 billion at the end of the fourth
quarter, Smith said, up from $10 billion the year before.
	   The company also boosted the quarterly dividend on its class H
shares to 25 cents a share from 24 cents, payable March 10 to
shareholders of record Feb. 6.
	   Class H shares are tied to the earnings of Hughes Electronics
Corp. GMH shares rose 1/2 to 61 3/4 in late morning trading.
