	   Detroit, Aug. 4 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. said it will
repurchase $2.5 billion in stock, its second big buyback program in
a year, but left its dividend unchanged, disappointing investors
who had been expecting a dividend boost as well as a buyback.
	   GM shares fell 1 13/16 in late morning trading to 62 5/8.
	   The shares had risen 15 percent in the five days ending Friday,
to 64 7/16. That was their highest level since 64 3/4 of Feb. 8,
1994.
	   ``I'm not trying to sneeze at $2.5 billion, but it's probably
not enough to move the market for a company of GM's size,'' said
Tom DiBella, vice president of Aeltus Investment Management in
Hartford, Connecticut. The firm recently sold its GM shares and
bought Chrysler Corp. stock, Dibella said.
	   GM's dividend yield of 3.2 percent remains below that of
Chrysler's 4.4 percent and Ford Motor Co.'s 4.1 percent.
	   The company said the shares would be bought back over 12 months
and would result in a 4.6 percent reduction in its shares
outstanding. The company repurchased 43.7 million shares beginning
last January in a just-ended $2.5 billion buyback.
	   GM said it would consider other ways to return cash to
shareholders.
	   ``We expect to consider additional programs in the future,
within the framework of the investment requirements to maintain and
grow the business, the overall business climate and our cash
position growing forward,'' Chairman and Chief Executive John Smith
Jr. said in a statement.
	   He said GM's cash position was strong. The company had $14.9
billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the second
quarter, up from $14.6 billion at the end of the first quarter and
$13.0 billion in the year-earlier second quarter. The increase came
despite the share repurchases and two strikes that cost the company
$490 million after taxes.
	   ``The company has basically met its cash goals,'' said Credit
Suisse First Boston analyst Nicholas Colas. A dividend increase
likely will come later, he said.
	   The company has increased its dividend in the first quarter of
each of the last two years, including a boost in its quarterly
payout to 50 cents a share from 40 cents in January, when it also
announced its previous $2.5 billion buyback program.
	   GM sees its shares as undervalued, said a spokesman, Jim Finn.
``We continue to believe the stock offers a good opportunity for
price appreciation,'' he said.
