	   Detroit, May 29 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. won't reach
its goal of boosting its U.S. market share to 33 percent in 1997
because of strikes that have crippled production, Chief Executive
John Smith Jr. said.
	   In 1996, when it also was hurt by strikes in the U.S. and
Canada, GM captured 31.3 percent of the U.S. market.
	   GM's U.S. market share, which for decades prior to the 1980s was
more than 40 percent, is considered a key test of the success of 14
redesigned vehicles the company is introducing this year.
	   Smith said GM's market share will be higher this year than in
1996, but he wasn't specific. However, Smith added, ``with the
strikes, it will be hard to hit 33 percent.''
	   GM, which lost $1.2 billion to strike-related expenses in 1996,
earlier this month said strikes in Oklahoma City and Pontiac,
Michigan, have cost the company $225 million this year. The
Oklahoma City strike was settled last weekend. The Pontiac strike
continues.
	   On Wednesday, UAW officials said GM agreed to create 280 jobs
now and possibly another 45 later to settle the Oklahoma strike.
Smith didn't comment specifically, but said today the settlement
allows the plant to stay competitive.
	   The Oklahoma City plant makes Chevrolet Malibu cars, one of the
automaker's most important new models, and Oldsmobile Cutlass cars.
	   The Pontiac plant makes full-sized, extended-cab pickup trucks,
which are among the company's most profitable vehicles.
	   GM's Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said he expects the proposed
spinoff of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary to be completed
by the fourth quarter of 1997. That's a few months later than
originally anticipated.
	   The company is unlikely to proceed this year with plans to sell
as much as 20 percent of its Delphi parts-making subsidiary to the
public, Pearce said.
	   GM shares fell 3/8 to 57 3/8 in midmorning trading.
