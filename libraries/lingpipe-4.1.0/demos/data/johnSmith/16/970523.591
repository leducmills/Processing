downgrade; adds final trading levels and closing prices.)
	   Mexico City, May 23 (Bloomberg) -- Mexican stocks fell for the
first time in six sessions after an increase in local money market
rates prompted many investors to sell shares and buy fixed-income
securities.
	   Auto parts maker SanLuis Corp. plunged 5.4 percent to 17 pesos
after General Motors Corp. chairman John Smith Jr. told
shareholders in Wilmington, Delaware that he's in no rush to settle
two United Auto Workers strikes that cost the company $225 million
in profits through May 15.
	   Last year, SanLuis sold GM $65 million in parts and is holding
almost $7 million worth of parts it has been unable to deliver
since the strikes began in early April.
	   The bolsa index slipped 11.23 to 3988.29. Yesterday, it closed
at 3999.52, its third record in as many days.
	   ``After the big run-up you're starting to see some anxiety creep
back into the market,'' said Tom Dibble, a trader at J.P. Morgan
Inc. in New York. ``The upside (in prices) is very limited.''
	   As the yield on the benchmark 30-year U.S. bond yield closed
little changed, helping the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 87.78
to a record 7345.91, many investors opted for the security of
shares north of the Rio Grande or bonds, analysts said.
	   Also, with Mexico's midterm elections just six weeks away, many
investors are beginning to cash-in recent gains to avoid any sudden
losses ahead of the July 6 vote, should the market fall on
political concern.
	   Many analysts are predicting that President Ernesto Zedillo's
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, may lose Mexico
City and its 68-year control over the 500-member Chamber of
Deputies.
	   If that happens, Zedillo's efforts to lower inflation and speed
the sale of government agencies to private investor may be slowed
by political infighting between the PRI, the center-left Democratic
Revolutionary Party and the center-right National Action Party.
	   Overall, 53 stocks dropped; 34 rose and 19 closed unchanged.
Trading totaled 59.5 million shares with a value of $118.7 million,
the least since May 2.
	   This week, shares rose 2.5 percent after local benchmark
one-month interest rates fell 84 basis points to 18.07 percent on
Tuesday and the Federal Open Market Committee left U.S. borrowing
costs unchanged. They should continue to rise in the next few days,
analysts said. ``The Mexican market will continue to grow,'' said
Jorge Sigg, who manages about $90 million for Grupo Financiero
BBV-Probursa SA. ``For foreign investors, Mexico continues to be
pretty cheap.''
	   Prices slumped after overnight Treasury bill rates jumped 150
basis points to 19.50 percent and the yield on overnight bank
promissory notes climbed to 18.90 percent, an 80 basis-point rise.
Shares recovered some of their losses later in the session after
overnight bank paper closed at 18.70 percent and overnight
government securities closed at 16.80 percent.
	   New York shares of Transportacion Maritima Mexicana SA, the
nation's largest ocean shipping company, closed unchanged at 5 1/2
after Standard & Poor's Credit Corp. and Moody's Investors Service
downgraded their ratings of the company's long-term debt
securities.
	   S&P cut its rating of TMM's long-term debt to ``BB-'' from
``BB'' while Moody's reduced its rating to ``Ba3'' from ``Ba2.''
	   S&P and Moody's analysts said a decline in TMM's Far East
shipping business and its 1996 purchase, with Kansas City Southern
Industries Inc., of Mexico's Northeast Railroad line for $1.4
billion, may hurt the company's ability to repay its loans.
	   TMM officials dismissed the ratings companies' concerns, saying
recent efforts to improve its Asian shipping business and its
expansion into railroads will soon deliver higher revenues and
earnings.
	   ``We're extremely optimistic about the future of TMM,'' said
company spokesman Pedro Mejorada. ``We will not leverage TMM to pay
for railroads.''
	   Between now and 2006, TMM has about $735 million in debt to
repay, beginning with $75 in bonds due on Oct. 28. The company has
to repay $90 million in debts next year and $20 million in 1998.
``We have a very comfortable repayment schedule,'' Mejorada said.
