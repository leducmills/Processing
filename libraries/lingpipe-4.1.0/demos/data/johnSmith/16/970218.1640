
	   DETROIT , General Motors Corp. is considering selling up to 20
percent of its huge automotive electronics and auto parts units,
John Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive, said Wednesday.
	   GM is in the process of adding its Delco Electronics Corp. to
its Delphi Automotive Systems unit to form the world's largest auto
supplier, with 210,000 employees and revenue of approximately $32
billion. GM also acknowledged Wednesday that it was cooperating
with the Justice Department, which is investigating whether
employees of GM or Volkswagen accepted kickbacks to steer contracts
to auto suppliers.
	   Smith said that Delphi, once Delco is merged with it, ``is
essentially going to be a smart systems, smart parts operation with
a focus on growth.'' Delco is a subsidiary of GM's Hughes
Electronics Corp.
	   GM announced last month that it would merge Delco with Delphi
and that it would sell Hughes' military businesses to Raytheon Co.
for the equivalent of $9.5 billion, pending approval by the
Pentagon and the Justice Department.
	   Delco designs and builds automotive electronics including
stereos, collision warning systems, electronic engine controls,
navigation systems and air bag and anti-lock brake modules. Delphi
makes brakes, radiators, heating and air-conditioning modules,
ignitions, seats, axles and other automotive components and sells
them to GM and other automakers worldwide.
	   If GM decides to sell part of Delphi, the stake sold ``would not
be more than 20 percent,'' Smith said. ``We would hold at least 80
percent of that company.'' Companies incur taxes if they carve out
more than 20 percent of a company.
	   Wall Street analysts said that selling part of Delphi would be a
good move. David Bradley, an auto analyst with J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc., said, ``Over all, the general reaction in the
market would be to see it as a big plus, for GM and for Delphi and
for GM shareholders.''
	   Auto executives in Detroit have been increasingly interested in
spinning off small stakes in large subsidiaries to help investors
put a value on their holdings. Ford Motor Co. issued stock last
year equal to 19.3 percent of the Associates, its consumer finance
unit, and the stock quickly soared, allowing investors to better
estimate the value of Ford's 80.7 percent stake.
	   American automakers have been nervously watching Japanese
automakers gain market share as the dollar has strengthened.
Wednesday Smith praised the recent decision by the Clinton
administration to signal that it did not seek further appreciation
in the dollar.
	   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Feb. 7 that while the
United States favored a strong dollar, the currency has been strong
for some time. ``It was a lot better than what he was saying
previously,'' Smith said.
	   Another GM executive said Wednesday that the company was
cooperating with an investigation related to its former purchasing
chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Prosecutors in the United
States, Germany and Switzerland are investigating allegations that
employees of Volkswagen and GM , notably GM's European division,
Opel , took bribes from auto suppliers in exchange for steering
contracts to them.
	   ``We are a victim, so we are cooperating with the Justice
Department, as you would expect,'' said Harry Pearce, GM's vice
chairman. ``I have no reason to believe that GM is a focus of this
investigation. My understanding is that there is an investigation
of Lopez and his followers.''
	   Plato Cacheris, Lopez's Washington-based lawyer, said, ``I have
not been contacted by the Justice Department so I cannot confirm
that there is a so-called investigation by them on this new
matter.''
