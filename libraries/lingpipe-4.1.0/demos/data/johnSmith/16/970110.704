	   One of the prime movers behind the GM case was Harry Pearce, a
former trial lawyer who is now the auto maker's powerful vice
chairman. It was Pearce, a soft-spoken but supremely focused
strategist who pushed top GM management to press a legal case
against Lopez. Together with Louis Hughes, GM president of
international operations, and some leading outside directors, the
executive suite at GM refused to let the Lopez case die.
	   At its headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, Friday, Volkswagen
executives kept a low profile but were clearly relieved to have
reached a settlement even if they do have to pay $100 million, only
a fraction of the $3 billion to $4 billion GM is said to have
demanded. ``The compromise is a little cloud on an otherwise bright
sky,'' said Klaus Kocks, a Volkswagen spokesman.
	   Volkswagen was desperate to settle the case not only to head off
a trial in the United States but because it also feared that the
publicity would damage its car sales in the United States. VW has
been successfully building back its sales in recent years after
some disastrous episodes in the early '90s, and it feared American
consumers would shun its products.
	   Its investors, meanwhile, were clearly elated by the settlement
and the agreement that GM would drop its suit. Volkswagen's stock,
which was hammered when Lopez was indicted in December, climbed 10
percent the last few days on rumors of a settlement. VW shares hit
a new high of 724.5 marks ($460) in Frankfurt Friday, though they
slipped back in after-hours electronic trading In New York, GM
shares jumped in heavy trading $1.925, to $61.025 a share, the
highest price in years.
	   The long-awaited settlement inevitably sparked endless
conjecture Friday about who ``won'' the feud. But in Germany, where
the fight has been nothing if not personal, there was a widespread
sense of relief that the fighting might be over.
	   ``The agreement is a long-overdue act of reason,'' said
Handelsblatt, Germany's leading business newspaper, in an editorial
Friday morning. The conflict will leave a stale aftertaste for a
long time to come, and it should serve as a warning to other
companies.''
	   Added the Nueste Nachrichten in Dresden: ``Management resources
have been abused to contemplate pretrial strategies and insults for
the enemy. It would have been better if this time had been used to
develop new vehicles.''
	   For General Motors, particularly its Opel subsidiary, the battle
with Lopez and Volkswagen was always about more than money. Lopez,
a charismatic Basque who had helped revolutionize the way that
General Motors bought components while at Opel and had saved the
company hundreds of millions of dollars, jumped ship after a
particularly bruising tug-of-war between between GM's chief
executive, John Smith Jr., and Ferdinand Piech, the chief executive
of Volkswagen. Lopez's resignation was all the more grating to GM
executives because he had at various times insisted he had no
intention of quitting. At one point, Smith had bent over backwards
to keep him happy by offering him the presidency of GM's huge North
American auto business.
	   What GM wanted as much as money was an apology of some sort.
Friday, GM lawyers said it turned out to be much easier to
negotiate the financial aspects of a settlement than the wording in
which Volkswagen would acknowledge that GM had been wronged.
	   On that score, GM got less than it wanted , a lukewarm statement
acknowledging GM's ``concerns with respect to possible
wrongdoing,'' and ``regrets'' by Volkswagen about its statements
disparaging GM's complaints.
	   Gottschalk said the company had gotten what it needed. ``An
apology is in the eye of the beholder, he said. And he added, ``A
hundred million dollars is not trivial.''
	   GM officials say they spent about $7.5 million on the entire
Lopez affair. Company executives also expended enormous personal
energy. General Motors began its detective work on March 16, 1993,
the day after Lopez resigned from GM. According to the company's
court complaint, executives from GM's worldwide purchasing group
took an inventory of Lopez's office and quickly found that a large
number of documents had disappeared.
	   Among the missing documents, GM said in its complaint, was a set
of documents about the ``Plant X'' studies that aimed to cut costs
by having large portions of a vehicle assembled by suppliers , not
the manufacturer , under one roof.
	   In addition to studies for Plant X, General Motors charged that
Lopez had taken thousand of documents and computer disks containing
information on the price and sources for 60,000 automobile parts,
pictures and information on future GM cars, strategic planning
documents and a wide range of other technical material.
	   GM executives say the data base on automobile parts, which
totaled about 4,000 pages, was among the most valuable information
it had lost because it provided the key to buying parts at the
lowest possible prices. Known as the European Purchasing
Optimization System, the data base had been meticulously compiled
over many years and would have been extremely difficult to
duplicate, GM lawyers said.
