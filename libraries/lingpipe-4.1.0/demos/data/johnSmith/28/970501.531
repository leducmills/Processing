	   London, May 1 (Bloomberg) -- Britain's Labour party won a
landslide victory in the general election, ending 18 years of
Conservative party rule, exit polls showed.
	   Labour captured 47 percent of the vote, giving the party an 18
percentage point lead over the Conservatives and giving Labour
leader Tony Blair, the next prime minister, a 100- to 200-seat
majority in the 659-seat House of Commons, according to a British
Broadcasting Corp. survey of voters leaving polling stations.
	   Separately, Independent Television News said its exit polling
suggested Labour would have a 159-seat majority over all other
parties, with 409 seats for Labour, 177 for the Conservatives, 45
for the Liberal Democrats and 28 for other parties.
	   While opinion polls suggested a Labour victory for some months,
the size of the victory suggested by the exit polls sent the
British pound rising against the dollar. The pound rose to $1.6298
from $1.6244 earlier in Europe.
	   ``The lead is on the high side of expectations and means that
Blair will have a strong hand on Parliament and won't have to rely
on the left of his party,'' said James Barty, a U.K. economist at
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
	   Before polls closed, financial markets were calm, with the
7.5-percent, 10-year British government bond rising 1/4 point or 25
pence per 100-pound bond, with its yield falling 3 basis points to
7.40 percent. The benchmark FT-SE 100 Index of U.K. shares rose 9
points to 4445.0.
	   Labour needs a clear 4-point lead over the Conservatives to have
a working majority in the Commons by having more seats than all the
other parties put together.
	   Polls this week showed Labour leading the Conservatives led by
Prime Minister John Major by between 13 and 21 percentage points,
indicating Blair will likely have a majority of 80 to 150 seats.
	   The Conservatives first swept to power under Margaret Thatcher
in 1979. Under Thatcher and Major, they implemented a radical
agenda by reducing income taxes, selling government-owned companies
and reducing the power of unions.
	   Blair has promised to maintain many of the Conservatives'
policies, pledging not to increase government spending for two
years and not to raise the basic 23 percent or top 40 percent
income tax bands in the first five years.
	   His election would reflect subtle changes in policy, especially
in Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe. While Major has
had to deal with members of his own party who oppose further moves
toward a federal Europe, Blair has said a Labour government would
sign Europe's social chapter, which sets standards for pay, hours
and other working conditions.
	   Although promising more cooperation with Europe, he has also
promised a referendum if the government decides the U.K. should
join the European single currency.
	   The Liberal Democrats, led by former soldier and diplomat Paddy
Ashdown, have run a distant third with about 18 percent support in
the polls, campaigning mainly on raising the basic income tax rate
1 percentage point to 24 percent to finance a 10 billion pound
($16.2 billion) five-year education program.
	   Pollsters have said voters are impressed by Labour's move away
from high-tax, high-spend polices, while internal rifts in the
Conservative party over Britain's membership of the European Union
cost the party support.
	   Campaigning has been dominated by the economy, tax and Britain's
future relations with its European Union partners and particularly
the single European currency due to start on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   Major said during the campaign Britain's economy is booming with
inflation and interest rates at historically low levels, and said a
Labour government would put that at risk.
	   The Conservative party leader came to power in November 1990,
after Thatcher resigned due to a revolt within her own party. He
unexpectedly won the party a fourth successive term in April 1992.
	   Blair became Labour leader after the sudden death of his
predecessor John Smith in 1994 and since then has steadily purged
the party of its high-spend and high-tax policies and its
commitment to national ownership of industrial assets.
