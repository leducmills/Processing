	   (Repeating to add Blair's age in second paragraph.)
	   London, May 2 (Bloomberg) -- Tony Blair became Britain's
youngest prime minister in 185 years, having persuaded voters that
he ended the U.K. Labour Party's support for such socialist tenets
as state ownership of industries and punitive taxation.
	   Investors, too, believed in the 43-year-old lawyer -- or at
least believed he was their best hope for keeping Labour policies
they like. With Labour's commanding lead in the polls, investors
had for months not worried whether Blair would win, but whether he
would win by enough to give him a free hand in shaping policy.
	   ``Markets priced in a Labour victory, but were concerned whether
opinion polls running up to the election showed their lead
narrowing,'' said Andrew Milligan, an economic advisor to GA
Investments Ltd., which manages $45 billion.
	   ``A small majority would mean a government that was more
vulnerable to demands from the party's left wing, which is
associated with tax-and-spend policies,'' he said.
	   Blair takes the record as youngest prime minister since Lord
Liverpool in 1812 from his John Major, the Conservative party
leader who was 47 when he became prime minister in 1990.
	   Labour, which had been out of power since 1979 and last won a
general election in 1974, captured 45 percent of the popular vote
Thursday to 31 percent for the Conservatives and 17 percent for the
Liberal Democrats.
	   The lead was largely due to efforts by Blair -- and by his
predecessors Neil Kinnock and John Smith -- to recast Labour as a
moderate, market-oriented alternative to its ideologically split,
scandal-tainted chief rival, the Conservatives.
	   They turned Labour from a socialist party that advocated state
ownership of major industries and income tax rates of as much as 90
percent into a party that pledged to stick to the present
Conservative government's taxation, spending and deficit-cutting
guidelines in its first two years of office.
	   Blair also pledged not to raise politically sensitive income tax
rates -- chiefly the 23 percent basic rate on annual income earned
above 4,101 pounds ($6,725) and the 40 percent top rate on income
above 26,100 pounds -- and add a special 10 percent rate for
low-paid workers.
	   Blair has been accepted by many within London's financial
community as a reformer who won't increase spending, which could
accelerate inflation, and will stick to the fiscally prudent
policies of the Conservatives.
	   ``A Labour government was inevitable and the market should feel
quite relaxed about it,'' said Graham Campbell, head of U.K.
equities at Edinburgh Managers Plc, which has 4 billion pounds in
British equities under management.
	   Investors had traditionally shunned Labour, wary of the high
deficits and 20 percent annual inflation rates that occurred the
last time the party controlled Parliament, after the two global oil
shocks of the 1970s.
	   This time, those most concerned about a Labour government were
investors in utility companies because Blair and Gordon Brown, his
designated Chancellor of the Exchequer, have said they intend to
levy a one-time tax on the electricity, water and other utilities
sold by Conservative governments.
	   Labour aims to tap water and power companies' ``excessive''
profits to fund an employment training program to take young people
off welfare. Blair hasn't detailed the tax rates or companies that
will be targeted, though analysts said they expect levies of 3
billion to 10 billion pounds when Brown presents his first budget
in July.
	   Other companies that may be targeted include BAA Plc, which
operates Heathrow and six other British airports, and British
Telecommunications Plc, both of which have a near-monopoly.
	   Blair became Labour leader in 1994 after the death at 55 of John
Smith, who himself worked to reform Labour after its last election
defeat in 1992.
	   Since then, Blair scrapped Labour's commitment to the public
ownership of major industries and weakened its historic links to
labor unions, which nonetheless continue to provide most of the
party's funding.
	   Unlike Major, who left a state-run school at 16 and never
attended college, Blair had a privileged education, graduating from
one of Scotland's top preparatory schools, Fettes College, before
earning a law degree at the University of Oxford.
	   While practicing employment law, Blair met his wife, Cherie
Booth, now a leading barrister, or trial attorney, and reputedly a
descendant of the brother of John Wilkes Booth, who killed U.S.
President Abraham Lincoln 132 years ago.
	   Blair was elected to Parliament 14 years ago representing
Sedgefield, a partly industrial, partly rural area of County Durham
in northeast England.
	   His political rise was as rapid as that of Major. Both men moved
from backbench legislator to party leader within 11 years.
	   After entering the Commons, Blair was named to the ``shadow
cabinet'' team, which represented Labour's positions on major
issues, and earned the respect not only of his own party, but of
government ministers whom he opposed. He cut his political teeth as
the party's employment spokesman and later as shadow home secretary
for domestic affairs.
	   In his career, Blair changed from supporting the policies of Old
Labour, including unilateral nuclear disarmament, to stand firmly
in the center ground of British politics, backing the market
economy.
	   Blair is a practicing Christian and although an Anglican, has
attended Catholic mass with his wife. He has said that his
religious beliefs ``influence my politics, but I don't wish to
force them on anyone else.''
	   ``I can't stand politicians who wear God on their sleeves,'' he
said. ``I don't pretend to be any better or less selfish than
anyone else, and I don't believe Christians should only vote
Labour.''
	   When he became leader in 1994, Blair gave his party warning of
the changes he planned for it.
	   ``At four successive general elections, the British people
refused to grant the Labour Party their trust,'' he said. ``They
didn't tell us to retreat or retire, they told us to come back with
a new prospectus for a new government.''
	   Blair consistently has said Labour under him won't raise taxes
or spending or make commitments without saying how much they would
cost and how they would be paid for.
	   ``When we make a promise, we must be sure we can keep it,'' he
said. ``That is page one, line one of a new contract between the
government and the citizen.''
	   Blair often has been compared in style with U.S. President Bill
Clinton in seeking to move to the political center. Labour is now
openly compared with the U.S. Democratic Party, offering policies
more liberal than the Conservatives but further to the right than
ever before.
	   He certainly helped make the general election campaign more
presidential, focusing on the character of party leaders as well as
broad party policies. Blair was seen as young, strong and a man of
his word, while Major was seen by voters as tired, weak and a man
who broke promises not to raise taxes last time.
	   However, Blair was also seen as a ``sound-bite'' politician
interested only in carefully manipulated media coverage, with no
experience at all of government.
	   Major charged him with simply adopting Conservative policies
after abandoning Old Labour. In a memorable quote about the
Conservatives having a ``wait-and-see'' policy about Europe, Major
said Labour also had a wait-and-see policy. ``They wait and see
what our policies are and then decide whether to copy them,'' he
said.
