
	   LONDON , Politicians in Britain sometimes look to the United
States the way New Yorkers look to California , to peer into the
possible future. With a mixture of fascination and dread, they
train their telescopes on the horizon and wonder which trends of
public fickledom will blow their way and which newfangled
techniques can be lifted for their own campaigns.
	   Thus, John F. Kennedy's victory in 1960 augured well for Labor,
the Democrats' natural affiliate here, and his ``New Frontier''
seemed to find an echo in Harold Wilson's 1964 campaign pledge to
forge a new prosperous era through the ``white heat of
technology.''
	   In 1992, President George Bush's defeat brought gloom to the
Conservatives of Prime Minister John Major, who had sent some Tory
strategists to lend him a hand. By the same token, Clinton's win
buoyed the hopes of Labor , starving in opposition ever since
Margaret Thatcher's election in 1979 , that their day might soon be
at hand.
	   Among the Laborites who crowded into a ballroom at London's
Dorchester Hotel to celebrate the inauguration of Clinton, none
were happier than a group of young Turks in the party called
``modernizers.''
	   In the same way that Clinton as governor of Arkansas had helped
create a more conservative and popular wing of the Democratic
Party, they were prodding Labor to turn its back on a tradition of
trade union domination and socialist egalitarianism.
	   This old-time religion, they calculated, offended the country's
swing voters among middle-class English, snatching defeat from the
jaws of victory time and time again.
	   This process , of moving the Labor Party to the mainstream of
British life , was called ``Clintonization'' and its prime
practitioner, who took over the mantle of party leadership when
John Smith died of a heart attack in 1994, was Tony Blair.
	   Last week Blair sat in the White House as a guest of President
Clinton while on a trip to New York and Washington to bolster his
international credentials.
	   Clinton and Blair have met before (at the funeral of Yitzhak
Rabin in Israel and during a presidential visit here last
November), but this was their first opportunity for substantive
talks.
	   At some point, surely, their conversation turned to politics,
since each of them is effectively at the beginning of a campaign.
Clinton's contest in November against Sen. Bob Dole will likely
come first, because Major is able to put off the showdown with
Blair until May 1997, though he retains the option of calling a
snap election before then.
	   In both countries, the campaigns will play out against an
uncertain economic background. In Britain, as in the United States,
economic growth has been restored and both inflation and
unemployment are low (the British figures are 2.7 percent and 7.9
percent respectively).
	   But, again as in the United States, economic insecurity is rife,
thanks to downsizing and corporate benefit-trimming. The
Conservatives' main hope is to institute a dramatic tax cut in the
next budget to reinforce their image as the cost-conscious party
that keeps money in the pockets of wage-earners.
	   One major difference between the two contests, of course, is
that Clinton is the incumbent and Blair is the challenger.
Superficially at least, the candidates are somewhat alike,
fast-talking men able to sketch out a vision of the way things
should be, running against opponents who embody stolid virtues of
the status quo and do not arouse much excitement on the stump.
