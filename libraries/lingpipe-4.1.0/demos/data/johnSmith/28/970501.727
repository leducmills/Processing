	   London, May 2 (Bloomberg) -- Britain's Labour party won a
majority in the House of Commons and was heading for a landslide
victory that will end 18 years of Conservative party rule and make
Tony Blair, 43, the youngest prime minister since 1812.
	   Conservative economic policies, on the other hand, will outlive
their designers. Blair has promised to maintain such cornerstones
of the former government as selling state assets, holding down
income taxes and spending, and capping inflation.
	   Labour's lead, which indicates it could top the 144-seat
majority won by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1983,
drove down the pound and U.K. bonds. Traders worried that a strong
Labour government may not feel compelled to stick with campaign
promises on taxes and spending.
	   The size of the win -- with television stations forecasting a
150- to 200-seat majority -- means Blair may avoid the party
infighting that plagued John Major in the last years of
Conservative rule, analysts said.
	   ``The new Parliamentary Labour party will have been voted in on
a platform of sticking to the current government's current public
expenditure programs and pursuing broadly similar macro-economic
policies to what (the Conservatives) have done in the last 10
years,'' said Stephen Yorke, the political strategist for SBC
Warburg.
	   The pound rose as high as $1.6299 and 2.8085 German marks after
the polls closed and voter surveys suggested Labour would win by
enough to avoid a hung Parliament. As Labour's margin grew,
sterling pared its gains and was last at $1.6235 and 2.7966 marks.
	   NatWest Securities said concerns about potential new taxes on
U.K. corporations have led to after-hours selling in stocks. It
said it expects the FT-SE 100 Stock Index to open 60 to 80 points
lower today, having closed at 4445 points Thursday.
	   Of the first 331 seats decided, Labour won 272, the
Conservatives 29 and the Liberal Democrats 21. Labour candidates
were gaining an average of 10 percent on their Conservative rivals
throughout Britain.
	   Four Conservative cabinet ministers have so far lost their
seats, including Defense Secretary Michael Portillo, Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, Trade Secretary Ian Lang and Scottish
Secretary Michael Forsyth. Portillo and Rifkind had been seen as
potential challengers to Major as party leader.
	   The scale of Labour's win was evident in such constituencies as
Birmingham Edgbaston, a seat in Britain's second-largest city that
the Conservatives had held since 1922. Labour candidate Gisela
Stuart won by a comfortable 4,842 votes.
	   Britons have chosen as their new prime minister a photogenic
lawyer first elected to Parliament in 1983. Blair became Labour
leader after the 1994 death of his predecessor, John Smith, and
since then has single-mindedly purged the party of its high-spend
and high-tax policies and its commitment to national ownership of
industrial assets.
	   The youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812, Blair
brings a youthful liveliness to 10 Downing Street. He loves to play
soccer and was a pop music singer in college.
	   ``If we have been as successful as has been indicated, it is a
vote for the future,'' Blair said in his acceptance speech in his
home town of Sedgefield in northern England. ``It is not a vote for
outdated dogma of any kind.''
	   The Conservatives swept to power under Thatcher in 1979. Under
Thatcher and Major, they implemented a radical agenda by reducing
income taxes, selling government-owned companies and reducing the
power of unions.
	   Blair has promised to maintain many of the Conservatives'
policies, pledging not to increase government spending for two
years and not to raise the basic 23 percent or top 40 percent
income tax bands in the first five years.
	   However, Labour is expected to raise some other taxes, to help
pay for its campaign pledges to spend more on education and health
care.
	   Blair, for example, has said he would impose a ``windfall tax''
on what he has said are excess profits by formerly state-owned
water and electricity companies sold to the public by the
Conservative government.
	   The U.K. fund management community also is concerned Labour may
scrap a 20 percent tax credit on share dividends available to
pension funds and other so-called institutional investors. That
could cause pensions to sells shares in favor of bonds, fund
managers have warned.
	   Blair's election would result in subtle changes in economic
policy, especially in Britain's relationship with the rest of
Europe. While Major has had to deal with members of his own party
who oppose further moves toward a federal Europe, Blair has said a
Labour government would sign Europe's social chapter, which sets
standards for pay, hours and other working conditions.
	   Although promising more cooperation with Europe, he has also
promised a referendum if the government decides the U.K. should
join the European single currency.
	   Analysts and investors also expect British interest rates to
rise this month, regardless of who wins the election, as the
economy continues to grow.
	   Britain's base rate, the rate at which the Bank of England lends
to banks overnight, was last raised a quarter-point to 6.00 percent
on Oct. 30. A report that gross domestic product grew 3 percent in
the first quarter has caused speculation rates must rise again to
prevent the inflation rate from rising.
	   To be sure, Blair's pledge to pursue relatively conservative
economic and social plans may be challenged by Labour's left wing.
The left has historically flexed its muscles when the party has had
a large majority.
	   The Liberal Democrats, led by former soldier and diplomat Paddy
Ashdown, have run a distant third with about 18 percent support in
the polls, campaigning mainly on raising the basic income tax rate
1 percentage point to 24 percent to finance a 10 billion pound
($16.2 billion) five-year education program.
	   Pollsters have said voters are impressed by Labour's move away
from high-tax, high-spend polices, while internal rifts in the
Conservative party over Britain's membership of the European Union
cost the party support.
	   The six-week campaign, twice as long as normal in Britain, was
dominated by the economy, tax and Britain's future relations with
its European Union partners and particularly the single European
currency due to start on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   Major said during the campaign that Britain's economy is
booming, with inflation and interest rates at historic lows, and
said a Labour government would put that at risk.
	   The Conservative party leader came to power in November 1990,
after Thatcher resigned due to a revolt within her own party. He
unexpectedly won the party a fourth successive term in April 1992.
