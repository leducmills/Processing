
	   LONDON , The leader of the opposition Labor Party said Tuesday
that once in power his party would not try to roll back changes
wrought by Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major in many
British institutions, from state-run industries now privatized to
once-powerful unions now curbed.
	   ``I believe passionately that our government will fail if it
sees its task as dismantling Thatcherism,'' said the Labor leader,
Tony Blair. ``We can't just switch the clock back to where we were
or we will fail. Our task is to build and create those things that
Thatcherism didn't deal with.''
	   Instead, the man widely expected to bring the center-left back
into office after 17 years in the political wilderness said that a
Labor government would concentrate on reforms in education and
welfare and attempts to improve the lot of ``the large underclass
of people set apart from society's mainstream.''
	   In foreign affairs, Blair said that Labor would look more kindly
upon further integration with Europe , an issue that has bedeviled
Major's Conservative Party for the last three years and has come
into play again this week with the European ban on British beef in
the scare over mad cow disease.
	   Blair said his party was more pro-European than the Tories. ``I
do not have to appease a large Euro-skeptic wing of the Labor
Party,'' he explained, referring to the Tory back-bench rebels who
have opposed Major on European unity.
	   The 43-year-old Blair, who is heavily favored to win a general
election that must be held by next spring, said he would value the
``special relationship'' with the United States but in the context
of improved relations with continental Europe.
	   ``If Britain has a leadership role in Europe, that is of
enormous assistance to it in its relationship to the United
States,'' he said. ``I reject completely this idea that we have to
choose between a trans-Atlantic relationship with the United States
and our relationship with Europe. The stronger the latter is, the
stronger the former will be.''
	   Blair outlined his views in a wide-ranging interview in
anticipation of a three-day visit he will pay to the United States
next week. He will meet business leaders in New York and then
travel to Washington for meetings with President Clinton, Vice
President Gore and congressional leaders.
	   The visit is his first since assuming the party leadership in
1994 after the death of John Smith. Since then he has pried the
Labor Party away from the left of the political spectrum,
jettisoning its long-held objective of nationalizing the means of
production and emphasizing issues like combating crime. The party's
slogan is ``New Labor.''
	   Blair, whose efforts to change the Labor Party are sometimes
compared to Clinton's in the Democratic Party, said that both
parties reached an impasse in the 1960s and 1970s. ``We were
big-government, special-interest-run parties and we never stopped
to ask the question what lay behind that,'' he said.
	   To critics who charge that in moving away from its bedrock
socialism, Labor no longer presents a principled alternative to the
free-market Tories, Blair said, ``What we are about is a set of
values, not a set of fixed economic government prescriptions, and
the basic essence of those values is that the individual thrives
best in a well-functioning community of people.''
	   He predicted that Major would call an election before May 1997.
``Six months ago, I would have said the government will struggle on
to next year,'' he observed. ``I think it is less certain now.
There is an accumulating air of decay. We're effectively almost in
an election situation now.''
