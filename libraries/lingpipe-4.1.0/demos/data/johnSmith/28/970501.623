	   London, May 2 (Bloomberg) -- Britain's Labour party was heading
for an historic election victory with a landslide majority that
will end 18 years of Conservative party rule and make Tony Blair,
43, the youngest prime minister since 1812.
	   Exit polls showed Labour capturing as much as 47 percent of the
popular vote, giving the party an 18 percentage point lead over the
Conservatives and a 150- to 200-seat majority in the 659-seat House
of Commons.
	   Labour's lead in the polls, which indicates it could top the
144-seat majority won by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in
1983 after the Falklands War, briefly lifted the British pound
against the dollar in New York. The size of the win means Blair may
avoid the party infighting that plagued John Major in the last
years of Conservative rule, analysts said.
	   ``The lead is on the high side of expectations and means that
Blair will have a strong hand on Parliament and won't have to rely
on the left of his party,'' said James Barty, a U.K. economist at
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
	   The pound rose as high as $1.6299 and 2.8085 German marks after
the polls closed and voter surveys suggested a Labour landslide. It
has since pared its gains and was last at $1.6235 and 2.7966 marks.
	   A British Broadcasting Corp. survey of voters leaving the
polling stations showed Labour winning 47 percent of the vote,
against 29 percent for the Conservatives and 18 percent for the
Liberal Democratic Party. A poll for Independent Television News
said Labour would have a 159-seat majority, while Sky Television
was predicting a 170-seat majority and the BBC said it could be as
high as 203.
	   Of the first 45 seats decided, Labour won 43, the Liberal
Democrats two and Conservatives none. Labour candidates were
gaining an average of 10 percent on their Conservative rivals
throughout Britain.
	   The scale of Labour's win was evident in such constituencies as
Birmingham Edgbaston, a seat in Britain's second-largest city that
the Conservatives had held since 1922. Labour candidate Gisela
Stuart won by 4,842 votes.
	   Majorities of these sizes would show that British citizens are
ready to enter a new era in politics and close the door on the
Thatcher-Major dynasty, the longest period that one party has
controlled Parliament this century.
	   ``If we have been as successful as has been indicated, it is a
vote for the future,'' Blair said in his acceptance speech in his
home town of Sedgefield in northern England. ``It is not a vote for
outdated dogma of any kind.''
	   The Conservatives swept to power under Thatcher in 1979. Under
Thatcher and Major, they implemented a radical agenda by reducing
income taxes, selling government-owned companies and reducing the
power of unions.
	   Blair has promised to maintain many of the Conservatives'
policies, pledging not to increase government spending for two
years and not to raise the basic 23 percent or top 40 percent
income tax bands in the first five years.
	   Analysts and investors also expect British interest rates to
rise this month, regardless of who wins the election, as the
economy continues to grow.
	   Britain's base rate, the rate at which the Bank of England lends
to banks overnight, was last raised a quarter-point to 6.00 percent
on Oct. 30. A report that gross domestic product grew 3 percent in
the first quarter has caused speculation rates must rise again to
prevent the inflation rate from rising.
	   Blair's election would result in subtle changes in economic
policy, especially in Britain's relationship with the rest of
Europe. While Major has had to deal with members of his own party
who oppose further moves toward a federal Europe, Blair has said a
Labour government would sign Europe's social chapter, which sets
standards for pay, hours and other working conditions.
	   Although promising more cooperation with Europe, he has also
promised a referendum if the government decides the U.K. should
join the European single currency.
	   And while pledging not to raise income taxes, Blair has said he
would impose a ``windfall tax'' on what he has said are excess
profits by formerly state-owned water and electricity companies
sold to the public by the Conservative government.
	   The U.K. fund management community also is concerned Labour may
scrap a 20 percent tax credit on share dividends available to
pension funds and other so-called institutional investors.
	   Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes Investment
Management, has warned that scrapping the tax would cause pension
funds to sell shares in favor of bonds, which could hurt the U.K.
stock market.
	   To be sure, Blair's pledge to pursue relatively conservative
economic and social plans may be challenged by Labour's left wing.
The left has historically flexed its muscles when the party has had
a large majority.
	   ``Certainly a majority of this size will allow some of the
left-wingers and other recalcitrants to disobey the whip and vote
against the government in certain particular measures,'' said
Stephen Yorke, a political strategist at SBC Warburg. ``But it will
be a minor irritation.''
	   The Liberal Democrats, led by former soldier and diplomat Paddy
Ashdown, have run a distant third with about 18 percent support in
the polls, campaigning mainly on raising the basic income tax rate
1 percentage point to 24 percent to finance a 10 billion pound
($16.2 billion) five-year education program.
	   Pollsters have said voters are impressed by Labour's move away
from high-tax, high-spend polices, while internal rifts in the
Conservative party over Britain's membership of the European Union
cost the party support.
	   The six-week campaign, twice as long as normal in Britain, was
dominated by the economy, tax and Britain's future relations with
its European Union partners and particularly the single European
currency due to start on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   Major said during the campaign that Britain's economy is
booming, with inflation and interest rates at historic lows, and
said a Labour government would put that at risk.
	   The Conservative party leader came to power in November 1990,
after Thatcher resigned due to a revolt within her own party. He
unexpectedly won the party a fourth successive term in April 1992.
	   Blair became Labour leader after the 1994 death of his
predecessor, John Smith, and since then has steadily purged the
party of its high-spend and high-tax policies and its commitment to
national ownership of industrial assets.
