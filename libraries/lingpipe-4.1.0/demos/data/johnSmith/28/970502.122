	   (Adds Major resignation as Conservative Party leader in 4th
paragraph, updates stock and pound prices from 3rd.)
	   London, May 2 (Bloomberg) -- Britain's Labour party won a
landslide majority in Parliament, ending 18 years of Conservative
party rule and making Tony Blair, 43, the youngest prime minister
since 1812.
	   Conservative economic policies, on the other hand, will outlive
their designers. Blair has promised to maintain such cornerstones
of the former government as selling state assets, holding down
income taxes and spending, and capping inflation.
	   U.K. stocks and bonds reversed earlier losses as expectations
that the new government would keep a tight rein on monetary policy
overrode previous concern that the size of the Labour majority
would prompt the party's more radical elements to urge an increase
in government spending.
	   ``We have been comprehensively defeated,'' departing Prime
Minister John Major said. Later, outside his former Downing Street
residence, Major said he will step down as Conservative party
leader after a ``brief interregnum.'' }q Sky News projected Labour
will hold a 177-seat overall majority, which would top the 144-seat
majority won by Margaret Thatcher in 1983 after the Falklands War.
	   The FT-SE 100 Stock Index, paced by exporters British Steel Plc
and TI Group Plc, rose 6.4 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4451.4. It
earlier slipped as low as 4423.6. Some traders had expected a drop
of as much as 2 percent.
	   ``The large majority is helpful because it sends a clear message
that voters want Labour to carry out the policies they said they
would,'' said Antony Hardy, a fund manager at Church Commissioners
which has 2 billion pounds in stocks.
	   The pound rebounded from a six-week low against the dollar and a
four-week low against the mark as investors focused on the
likelihood that interest rates could rise as soon as next week from
their current 6 percent.
	   The pound, which fell as low as $1.6007 and 2.7572 deutsche
marks, recovered to $1.6102 and 2.784 marks.
	   ``We've had reasonable comments from Blair, but everyone knows
he will be under pressure to sort out the problem areas like health
and education and so people are nervous about their policy
stance,'' said Tony Norfield, the treasury economist at ABN Amro
Bank.
	   With 633 seats of 659 reported, Labour has 418, the
Conservatives have 160, the Liberal Democrats 44 and other parties
11. Labour garnered about 45 percent of the vote, compared to 31
percent for the Conservatives. In the 1992 election, the share of
the vote was 35 percent and 43 percent respectively.
	   The Conservatives were headed for their smallest showing in
Parliament since 1906.
	   Six of 23 Conservative cabinet ministers have so far lost their
seats, including Defense Secretary Michael Portillo, Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, Trade Secretary Ian Lang, Leader of the
House Tony Newton, Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth and Chief
Treasury Secretary William Waldegrave.
	   Portillo and Rifkind had been seen as potential rivals to Major
as party leader. Michael Heseltine, formerly deputy prime minister
has been installed as favorite to succeed Major at bookmaker
William Hill. Labour's majority means Blair may avoid the party
infighting that plagued Major in the last years of Conservative
rule, analysts said.
	   For his part, Blair will name his cabinet today. Gordon Brown
has been promised the key post of managing the economy's
purse-strings, replacing current Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke.
	   The scale of Labour's win was evident in such constituencies as
Birmingham Edgbaston, a seat in Britain's second-largest city that
the Conservatives had held since 1922. The Labour candidate there
won by a comfortable 4,842 votes.
	   Britons have chosen as their new prime minister a photogenic
lawyer first elected to Parliament in 1983. Blair became Labour
leader after the 1994 death of his predecessor, John Smith, and has
since single-mindedly purged the party of its high-spend and
high-tax policies and commitment to state ownership of industrial
assets.
	   Blair, the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool served
almost two centuries ago, is expected to bring new zest to the
prime minister's office at 10 Downing Street. He has three
school-age children, loves to play soccer and was a pop music
singer in his college at Oxford University. ``The people of Britain
have united behind new Labour,'' Blair told hundreds of supporters
at a dawn rally for the party in central London. ``Now we have a
chance to make things happen and we take that responsibility upon
us and we will discharge it.''
	   The Conservatives swept to power under Thatcher in 1979 and
implemented a radical agenda of reducing income taxes, selling
government-owned companies and reducing the power of unions.
	   Blair has promised to maintain many of the Conservatives'
policies, pledging not to increase government spending for two
years and not to raise the basic 23 percent or top 40 percent
income tax bands in the first five years.
	   ``The general view is that macro-economic policy, by which I
mean growth, inflation, interest rates, will be broadly similar,
whoever won this election,'' said David Kern the chief U.K.
economist at National Westminster Bank Plc.
	   However, Labour is expected to raise some taxes, to help pay for
campaign pledges to spend more on education and health care.
	   Blair, for example, has said he would impose a ``windfall tax''
on what he has said are excess profits by formerly state-owned
water and electricity companies sold to the public by the
Conservative government.
	   The U.K. fund management community also is concerned Labour may
scrap a 20 percent tax credit on share dividends available to
pension funds and other so-called institutional investors. That
could cause pensions to sells shares in favor of bonds, fund
managers have warned.
	   Blair's election would result in subtle changes in economic
policy, especially in Britain's relationship with the rest of
Europe. While Major was handcuffed by members of his own party who
oppose further moves toward a federal Europe, Blair has said a
Labour government would sign Europe's social chapter, which sets
standards for pay, hours and other working conditions.
	   Although promising more cooperation with Europe, Blair also has
promised a referendum if the government decides the U.K. should
join the proposed European single currency.
	   Analysts and investors also expect British interest rates to
rise as much as half a percentage point this month, regardless of
who won the election, to prevent economic growth from causing
inflation to accelerate.
	   Brown ``will grasp the nettle with a mid- to long-term (interest
rate) increase,'' said Jeremy Stretch, a currency analyst at
NatWest Markets.
	   Britain's base rate, the rate at which the Bank of England lends
to banks overnight, was last raised a quarter-point to 6 percent on
Oct. 30. A report that gross domestic product grew 3 percent in the
first quarter has fanned speculation rates must rise again to
prevent the inflation rate from rising.
	   To be sure, Blair's pledge to pursue relatively conservative
economic and social policies may be challenged by Labour's left
wing. The left has historically flexed its muscles when the party
has had a large majority.
	   The Liberal Democrats, led by former soldier and diplomat Paddy
Ashdown, ran a distant third with about 18 percent support in the
polls, campaigning mainly on raising the basic income tax rate 1
percentage point to 24 percent to finance a 10 billion pound ($16.2
billion) five-year education program.
	   Pollsters have said voters were impressed by Labour's move away
from high-tax, high-spend polices, while internal rifts in the
Conservative party over Britain's membership of the European Union
cost the party support.
	   Major's six-week-long campaign, twice as long as normal in
Britain, failed to focus voters' attention on the country's
fast-growing economy.
