	   He has been feted in Britain and abroad; denounced as the Stalin
of the British left and hailed as its savior; profiled, interviewed
and investigated by the British press, the foreign press and the
tabloid press.
	   But the phenomenon of Tony Blair, the man who became leader of
the British Labor Party in the spring of 1994 and is the leading
contender to become Britain's next prime minister, is best
illuminated by a conversation that took place in the lobby of the
German parliament.
	   A member of the Green Party was describing to me the impression
Blair had made during his 1996 trip to Germany. Practically the
whole of the Bundestag had heard him speak, she said.
	   ``What really excited us was this new idea of reinventing the
left. Tony Blair is reinventing the left.''
	   I asked her what exactly that meant, the reinvention of the
left.
	   She winced slightly, and paused. ``I don't remember any of the
details, exactly,'' she replied, ``but this reinvention of the left
is very important.''
	   It would be hard to find a better illustration of the feelings
that Blair inspires. He undoubtedly interests people, in Britain
and perhaps even more so in the rest of Europe. He even seems to
many to be the harbinger of a whole new kind of European politics,
a 21st-century politics.
	   He speaks frequently of transcending left-right divisions, of
leaving old ideas of party loyalty behind. In the three years he
has been leader of Britain's opposition, he has galvanized his
party, rejuvenated its supporters and mounted the first serious
challenge to the Tories since 1979, something that previous Labour
reformers such as Neil Kinnock and John Smith never managed.
	   So who is Tony Blair and what does it mean to reinvent the left
in a post-Thatcherite Britain and a post-communist Europe?
	   The importance of that last question has frequently eluded
American commentators who write about Blair. That is because unlike
America's Democrats, the British Labor Party was genuinely
socialist.
	   Its members believed in a planned economy and nationalized
industry, preferred state housing projects to private developments,
and thought a ``fair'' society could be created with taxes as high
as 90 percent of income.
	   Many of them, including some of the party's leaders, still think
that way. A member of the Labor Party's shadow cabinet once told me
that the privatization of British industry in the 1980s was only a
phase:
	   ``There are fashions for these things. At the moment,
nationalization is out of fashion. Who knows, 20 years from now, it
might come back in again.''
	   It is precisely because the Labor Party's belief in socialist
economic solutions has long been so strong that any attempt to
alter it must have an equal intellectual force. Since he became his
party's leader , indeed, since long before he became its leader ,
Blair has tried to muster that intellectual force, both to exorcise
Labor's socialist instincts and to replace them with something new.
	   Although he is frequently compared with Bill Clinton, Blair's
political position is different from Clinton's in that the first of
his tasks , transforming his party , was a genuine struggle.
	   Clinton easily reinvented the Democrats as a centrist party:
They were centrists already. But Blair has had to reassure
Conservative voters that the Labor Party is no longer ``dangerous''
to the British economy while simultaneously preserving his base
among Labor socialists.
	   He began by demonstrating that his personal break with socialism
is complete. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, a newspaper
historically linked to the Conservative Party, Blair declared that
he admires Margaret Thatcher for her reinvention of the right
nearly 15 years ago, an unthinkable sentiment for any previous
Labor leader.
	   During his first year in office Blair waged a surprisingly
hard-fought campaign to rid the Labor constitution of its notorious
``Clause 4,'' which proclaimed the goal of ``securing for the
workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry, and
the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible, upon
the basis of common ownership of the means of production,
distribution, and exchange.''
	   Although he replaced it with a somewhat anodyne call for ``a
dynamic economy ... a just society ... an open democracy ... a
healthy environment,'' he made his point: The Labor Party has
changed.
	   Still, when the history of Britain's Labor Party is written, the
real break from socialism will probably be dated from Jan. 20,
1997, the day that Gordon Brown, Labor's shadow chancellor of the
exchequer, announced that a future Labor government would not raise
personal income taxes during its first term in office , and would
not increase public spending for its first two years in office.
	   With that statement, which took most of the Labor Party by
surprise, nearly two decades of Labor attacks on ``Tory cuts'' and
the ``unfair Tory tax system'' fell by the wayside, along with more
than four decades of socialist assumptions. Brown was telling not
only the voters, but the nursing, teaching, and public sector
unions who support the Labor Party that a Labor government's top
priority would not be spending.
	   Hardly surprising, then, that last year, when their own polling
revealed that most voters do indeed believe Tony Blair is different
from his predecessors, even Tories gave up trying to identify him
with his party's socialist past.
	   They instead invented a new slogan: ``New Labor, New Danger.''
Nevertheless, the more important part of Blair's mission ,
explaining what will replace socialism , remains unfulfilled. If
opinion polls register opposition to the Tories, they also register
quite a bit of confusion about what the Labor Party now believes.
	   Worse, many people still think that Blair is untrustworthy or
insincere, or that he stands for nothing at all. British tabloids
describe him as ``smarmy,'' and the label has stuck.
	   Some of this confusion would have arisen with any effort to
change the left. On one hand, Blair has discarded his party's
belief in managed markets and nationalized industry, and even some
aspects of the welfare state previously considered sacrosanct,
including the absolute right to public housing. Even his pledge to
restrict spending would have been unthinkable in the past.
	   On the other hand, he continues to reject British right-wing
philosophies of individualism and what he describes as
``unfettered'' capitalism. What he is left with is a firm but
ill-defined belief in the power of the state not only to regulate
society but to improve it , albeit without spending any money.
	   As Blair himself said in an article in the Sunday Mirror in
1994: ``Labor's vision is of a Britain that is not just a
collection of individuals but a society where a decent community
backs up the efforts of individuals within it. That change can't
come through market forces. It needs active government, local and
national.''
	   But ``belief in the state'' or in ``active government'' does not
by itself provide enough definition to satisfy most voters,
particularly those accustomed to the partisan gunfight that is
British politics.
	   To some, Blair's talk of community and society still sounds like
the language of the old Labor Party. When he throws around words
like ``responsibility'' and ``entrepreneurship,'' on the other
hand, he appears to others to have borrowed Tory language
wholesale.
	   The truth is that Blair and his colleagues have advocated a
strikingly wide range of policies. Some grossly contradict one
another, some complement one another, and some appear to have been
floated simply to gauge public reaction before being discarded.
	   On rare occasions one set of ideas appears to dominate and is
hailed as the philosophy designated to replace socialism.
	   Over time, however, the dust has settled. It now seems as if it
is precisely the contests and contrasts between policies and
philosophies that define both ``new Labor'' and the reinvention of
the left.
	   There is no ideology or framework, or even a big idea. There is
only a list of perceived problems , the damage that globalization
supposedly inflicts on British communities, the need to reverse the
``short-termist'' instincts of British capitalism and transform
corporate culture, the need for welfare reform, ``modernization,''
and radical constitutional reform , and an elaborate rhetoric that
describes a modest set of proposed solutions.
	   But in fact there's a pattern in Blair's politics: Make strong
proposals, allow them to be picked up and mulled over by the press,
retreat if the criticism is too harsh. The charitable explanation
for such behavior is that Blair fears his ideas will be twisted and
exaggerated during the traditionally nasty campaign season leading
up to the general election.
	   Given that Labor has lost four elections running, the last thing
he wants to do is frighten voters. The less charitable explanation
is that Blair doesn't really know what he believes , or that he
claims to believe different things at different times, depending on
his audience.
	   The latter explanation has certainly been applied to another
strand of Blairism, his tendency toward what Americans might
recognize as communitarian thinking.
	   Some might also call it paternalism; the unsympathetic would
call it authoritarianism. Asked directly, Blair will agree that he
is interested in communitarianism and has read communitarian
writings, but shies away from plainly identifying himself with the
philosophy , just as he shies away from plainly identifying himself
with any philosophy. Nevertheless, he has employed the language of
communitarianism in his speeches.
	   ``For myself,'' he said in a speech at Southwark Cathedral in
January 1996, ``I start from a simple belief that people are not
separate economic actors competing in the marketplace of life. They
are citizens of a community. We are social beings, nurtured in
families and communities and human only because we develop the
moral power of personal responsibility for ourselves and each
other.''
	   What made that speech interesting was that Blair did not then
continue (as his predecessors would have) by describing what the
rich owe the poor, or what the state owes its citizens.
	   In fact, rather than talking about what the state can give to
people, Blair adopts the kind of language that British
conservatives normally use, speaking of duties and responsibilities
that come with rights and rewards.
	   In the same speech, Blair went on to say that ``the key is to
recognize that we owe a duty to more than self. Responsibility
applies from top to bottom of society, from the responsibility to
pay taxes to fund common services, to the responsibility of fathers
to their children after a divorce, to the responsibility of people
to respect the lives of their neighbors.''
	   That, at any rate, is the theory. In practice, this new emphasis
on the needs and duties of community has resulted in a different
Labor attitude toward law-and-order issues and some neighborhood
and family topics that might once have seemed beneath the dignity
of a national politician.
	   Blair first hinted at a change of direction in the annual
Spectator magazine lecture, which he delivered in March 1995, an
address best described as his ``noisy neighbors'' speech.
	   Announcing that ``duty is the cornerstone of a decent society,''
he condemned noisy inhabitants of public housing developments,
calling for their eviction or the confiscation of their stereos:
``Families have the right to be housed but they do not have any
right to terrorize those around them, be it with violence, racial
abuse or noise. If tenants do not fulfill their side of the
bargain, the contract is broken.''
	   Using similar language, Blair has called for curfews for youths,
penalties for parents who do not assure that their children attend
school, and more homework. In these and other areas, he often
sounds a great deal like Bill Clinton, who is also interested in
communitarianism and curfews.
	   In fact, the two men advocate similar causes for similar
reasons: both are trying to signal a change of direction, a change
of heart in their respective parties.
	   In the past, the Labor Party was not much interested in
discussing the unpleasantness of life in Britain's deteriorating
public housing developments and state schools, preferring to
complain that there were not enough public housing developments and
state schools to begin with.
	   In the past, Labor leaders did not interest themselves in noise
but in ``social justice.''
	   In the past, the Labor Party concerned itself with the economic
rights of the public, not people's duty to the community.
