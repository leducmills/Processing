	   (Updates with British pound rising in fifth paragraph.)
	   London, May 1 (Bloomberg) -- Britain's Labour party captured 47
percent of the popular vote in the general election, giving it a 18
percentage point lead over the ruling Conservative party, a survey
of voters leaving polling stations showed.
	   The poll by the British Broadcasting Corp. showed 47 percent of
people surveyed said they had voted for Labour, 29 percent for the
Conservatives and 18 percent for the Liberal Democrats.
	   It suggests Tony Blair's Labour will form the next government
with a 100- to 200-seat majority in the 659-seat House of Commons,
ending 18 years of Conservative rule.
	   A separate exit poll by MORI for Independent Television News
predicted a 159-seat majority.
	   While opinion polls suggested a Labour victory for some months,
the size of the victory suggested by the exit polls sent the
British pound rising against the dollar. The pound rose to $1.6298
from $1.6244 earlier in Europe.
	   Before polls closed, financial markets were calm, with the
7.5-percent, 10-year British government bond rising 1/4 point or 25
pence per 100-pound bond, with its yield falling 3 basis points to
7.40 percent. The benchmark FT-SE 100 Index of U.K. shares rose 9
points to 4445.0.
	   The ITN poll historically has given an accurate indication of
the eventual outcome by quizzing voters after they actually cast
their ballots at polling stations across the country.
	   Britain's electoral system based on constituencies which each
return a member of Parliament by a simple majority means exit polls
calculated using nationwide percentages don't necessarily translate
directly into seats won by either party.
	   Recent opinion polls asking people their voting intentions gave
Labour a lead averaging 16 points over the Conservatives.
	   Labour needs a clear 4-point lead over the Conservatives in
order to have a working majority in the Commons by having more
seats than all the other parties put together.
	   Polls this week have shown Labour leading the Conservatives
under Prime Minister John Major by between 13 and 21 percentage
points, indicating Blair will likely have a majority of 80 to 150
seats.
	   The Conservatives first swept to power under Margaret Thatcher
in 1979. Under Thatcher and Major, they implemented a radical
right-wing agenda by reducing income taxes, selling government
assets and reducing the power of unions.
	   Blair has promised to maintain many of the Conservatives'
policies, pledging not to increase government spending for two
years and not to raise the basic 23 percent or top 40 percent
income tax bands in the first five years.
	   His election would reflect subtle changes in policy, especially
in Britain's relationship with the rest of Europe. While Major has
had to deal with members of his own party who oppose further moves
toward a federal Europe, Blair has said a Labour government would
sign Europe's social chapter, which sets standards for pay, hours
and other working conditions.
	   Although promising more cooperation with Europe, he has also
promised a referendum if the government decides the U.K. should
join the European single currency.
	   The Liberal Democrats, led by former soldier and diplomat Paddy
Ashdown, have run a distant third with about 18 percent support in
the polls, campaigning mainly on raising the basic income tax rate
by one percentage point to 24 percent to finance a 10 billion pound
($16.26 billion) five-year education program.
	   Pollsters have said voters are impressed by Labour's move away
from high-tax, high-spend polices to a more right-wing agenda,
while internal divisions in the Conservative party over Britain's
membership of the European Union cost the party support.
	   Campaigning has been dominated by the economy, tax and Britain's
future relations with its European Union partners and particularly
the single European currency due to start on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   Major said during the campaign Britain's economy is booming with
inflation and interest rates at historically low levels, and said a
Labour government would put that at risk.
	   He came to power in November 1990, after Thatcher resigned due
to a revolt within her own party. He unexpectedly won the party a
fourth successive term in April 1992.
	   Blair became Labour leader after the sudden death of his
successor John Smith in 1994 and since then has steadily purged the
party of its high-spend and high-tax policies and its commitment to
national ownership of industrial assets.
