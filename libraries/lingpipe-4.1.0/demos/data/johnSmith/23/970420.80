
	   The author Michael Dorris, who committed suicide last week, was
best known for ``The Broken Cord,'' a book about fetal alcoholism
syndrome, and as the collaborator of his wife, the best-selling
novelist Louise Erdrich. The facts of Dorris' background are still
being sorted out, but he claimed Modoc Indian descent. Whatever his
background, he was a tireless promoter of a range of young American
Indian talent, both as a reviewer and behind the scenes.
	   ``Michael used his name and his power and his popularity to help
put many of us newcomers on the map,'' said Greg Sarris, author of
the 1995 novel ``Grand Avenue.'' ``Michael reviewed books more than
any Indian I know.''
	   Now many of the writers whom Dorris nourished are beginning to
tell the American Indian story in a new way.
	   Until a generation ago, most books about Indians were
ethnographies or biographies, often written by nonnatives,
sometimes ``faux Indians'' looking for spiritual answers in native
myths. The Indian authors who gained prominence in recent years ,
N. Scott Momaday, Leslie Marmon Silko, James Welch, Ms. Erdrich ,
are writers of lyrical prose whose work is mostly set on
reservations and suffused with longing for the vanished coherence
of the tribal world.
	   But a new generation of Indian writers is emerging. Writers like
Sarris, 44, who is part Pomo and Coastal Miwok, and Sherman Alexie,
30, a member of the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene tribe and the author of
``Indian Killer,'' which gained wide critical attention when it was
published last year, are beginning to rethink the Indian story in
works that are increasingly hard edged and urban, distinctly
individual and full of references to pop culture.
	   The characters in Alexie's works, for instance, are not the
usual kinds of Indians. They are not the traditional shamans or
earth mothers. They are not tragic victims or noble savages. They
listen to Jimi Hendrix and Hank Williams: they dream of being
basketball stars. And unlike most Indians in fiction, they are
sometimes funny.
	   ``We're catching up,'' said Alexie, who has described himself as
``mouthy, opinionated, arrogant.'' This spring, shooting is
scheduled to begin on what would be the first all-Indian movie,
based on his collection of stories, ``The Long Ranger and Tonto
Fistfight in Heaven.'' Christopher Eyre, a Cheyenne-Arapaho, is to
direct, and the cast is to be all Indian.
	   While the idea of the Indian as a kind of Adam, with a special
or mystical connection to the natural world, is deeply ingrained in
the American psyche, Alexie, Sarris, Joy Harjo, Aaron Carr, David
Treuer, Susan Power and other Native American writers are
deliberately playing with the stereotype of the half-naked native
in his Eden.
	   Ms. Harjo, the Muscogee Indian poet, chants to reggae, jazz and
rock, played by her all-Indian rock band Poetic Justice. Carr's
``Eye Killers,'' published in 1995, is an Indian vampire novel
praised in Publishers Weekly for ``skillfully blending the Native
American oral tradition and the Gothic thriller.''
	   And with 65 percent of the two million Indians in the United
States living in cities, these writers are also taking their
characters off the reservation. ``Indian Killer'' takes place in
Seattle. Sarris set ``Grand Avenue'' (made into one of HBO's
highest-rated films last year, with Robert Redford as executive
producer) in Santa Rosa, Calif.
	   The first Indian novelist to enter the mainstream was Momaday
with ``House Made of Dawn,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1969.
Ms. Silko followed in 1977 with ``Ceremony,'' then ``Almanac of the
Dead.'' But it was Ms. Erdrich who broke ground with her 1984
novel, ``Love Medicine.'' It was a book that had failed to find a
publisher until Dorris, who was then her husband, became her editor
and agent.
	   ``Momaday and Silko were very spiritual,'' said Sarris, who is
also a professor of English at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``But Erdrich was dealing with the drinking and funkiness
we all know from everyday life. Before then, Indian writers didn't
want to think of Indians as fooling around, cheating on each other,
the way everyone else does.''
	   The new Indian writing is a reflection of these authors' complex
lives, growing up walking a cultural tightrope, on the one hand
hearing echoes of old tribal stories and on the other immersed in
MTV.
	   The result, paradoxically, is that the image of the Indian is an
American metaphor again, but now for the displaced person, the
orphan without an identity, personified in Alexie's hero in
``Indian Killer,'' John Smith, a man who doesn't know his tribe. A
common theme among these writers, many of whom are of mixed blood,
is the search for an identity in a world where cultural boundaries
are gradually disappearing.
	   The character of John Smith expresses some of the confusion in
Alexie's own upbringing. He was raised in Wellpinit, the only town
on the Spokane Indian Reservation, 50 miles northwest of Spokane,
Wash., where his mother is a drug and alcohol counselor and his
father worked as a laborer. He went to an all-white high school in
Reardan, a town bordering the reservation, where he was an honor
student, captain of the basketball team and the only player with a
long ponytail.
	   He went on to Gonzaga University in Spokane, then to the
University of Washington, along the way developing a drinking
problem. (He has since stopped drinking.) At the University of
Washington, he began writing in a poetry class. His early work was
accepted by Hanging Loose, a Brooklyn-based literary magazine.
Later his collection of stories, ``The Lone Ranger and Tonto
Fistfight in Heaven,'' published in 1993, won a PEN/Hemingway Award
citation for best first book of fiction.
	   ``Somebody forgot the charcoal; blame the BIA,'' one character
says in a moment of self-mockery, when a barbecue at a reservation
party falls apart, poking fun at a tendency among Indians to blame
the Bureau of Indian Affairs for all problems.
