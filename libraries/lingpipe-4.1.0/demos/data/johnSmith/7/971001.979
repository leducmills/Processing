
	   Early last month, a couple, perhaps in their mid-60s, took in
the oceanfront sights of Jacksonville, Fla. Their matching jackets
and caps identified them as proud Central Michigan University
supporters.
	   In fact, they were alumni, come south for what they jokingly
referred to as ``The Game.''
	   A day earlier, the Central Michigan Chippewas had played the
high-powered, top-ranked Florida Gators. The game was a Chippewa
disaster. Florida won, 82-6, the worst loss in Central Michigan
history.
	   But the couple wasn't angry, wasn't embarrassed. ``Hey, we never
thought we'd get to play a program like Florida,'' the man said.
``We got $300,000 for the game, so it wasn't all bad.''
	   In fact, Central Michigan received a $350,000 guarantee, but not
everyone was thrilled. ``We received some flak,'' said Herb
Deromeli, the Central Michigan athletic director and former head
football coach. ``When I say flak, some people responded, and I
responded back.
	   ``No one complained when we beat Michigan State two out of three
times,'' he said, referring to victories in the 1991 and 1992
seasons. The game with Florida was actually scheduled in 1991, when
Deromeli was the head coach. He became the athletic director in
1994.
	   In the fragile ecosystem of college football, administrators
feed their football programs to predators as a way of keeping
healthy. Athletes march bravely into combat, convinced that the sky
is blue when it in fact is green.
	   ``When you're in schools like ours, you have to look at your
finances,'' Deromeli said.
	   ``It would be great if the money came form other sources. If
John Smith came in and said, `Here's $300,000 so you don't have to
go to Florida,' that's fine. Then maybe you might want to rethink
it.''
	   Central Michigan is a member of the Mid-American Conference, a
10-team league that is attempting to increase its profile by
playing schools like Florida and Nebraska. Its other members are
Akron, Ball State, Bowling Green, Eastern Michigan, Kent, Miami of
Ohio, Ohio University, Toledo and Western Michigan.
	   Bill Lynch, the head coach at Ball State, said that from the
players' standpoint, there should be no shame. ``It's a great
challenge for them,'' Lynch said. ``It's an opportunity for our
guys to go play against teams many of them grew up watching. Every
now and then, we knock one of them off.
	   ``Our fans get excited about the opportunity to see if an upset
can take place.''
	   Already this season, Marshall and Miami of Ohio defeated Army,
Ohio University defeated Maryland and Toledo defeated Purdue. Ball
State lost to Indiana, 33-6, and lost to Purdue, 28-14. At the same
time, Akron lost to Nebraska, 59-14, and lost to Louisiana State,
56-0. Last weekend, Bowling Green lost to Kansas State, 58-0, and
this Saturday it will play Nebraska.
	   Jerry Ippoliti, the Mid-American commissioner, looked at the
routs and saw the glass as half full. ``If I was a school like
Kentucky and got beat 55-28 by Florida, I'd be concerned about
it,'' he said, ``because we're talking about budgets that are about
24 million dollars in their athletic program to maybe the highest
we might have is $9 million. Look at Iowa-Iowa State'' , Iowa won,
63-20 , ``look at that rout. Iowa State has four times the budget
any one of our schools has. They are in the Big 12. How do you
justify that?''
	   It is one thing to compete as a Big 12 member and lose, quite
another to accept an invitation to certain slaughter for a
guaranteed profit. Ippoliti said the aim of the conference is to
increase its visibility. ``We've really focused on football the
last four or five years because of having to maintain our Division
I attendance requirements. Every one of our institutions,
facility-wise, has improved their football stadium.''
	   The bottom line of the Mid-American's search for higher
visibility, its forays into elite competition, is to make ends meet
and to do so as gracefully as possible.
	   ``There are Title IX issues that now affect supporting men's and
women's programs,'' Ippoliti said. ``Therefore, $350,000 or
$400,000 certainly is an enhancement to anyone's budget.''
	   What about the student athlete, thrown into a situation that is
often hopeless , and humiliating? Ippoliti sees it as opportunity,
not exploitation. ``I think we have to look at our country,'' he
said. ``When you're looking at the philosophical approach to
intercollegiate athletics, as in the business world, you're trying
to do the best you can against the best. You never know until you
try.''
	   The Mid-American Conference will continue to take on the fat
cats. Some members will take lumps, Ippoliti said, but the ebb and
flow of college football virtually insures that, now and then,
there will be a breakthrough.
	   ``You never know when you'll hit the cycle,'' he said. ``You hit
the cycle when one of the elite teams are down, then you've got a
chance to win.'' And if you hit the cycle when they're up?
	   ``That's a risk,'' he said.
