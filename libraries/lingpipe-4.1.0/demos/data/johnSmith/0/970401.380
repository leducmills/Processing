	   LOS ANGELES , Joanna Ng of Woodland Hills has a list of goals:
attend college, skate in the Olympics and join the cast of Walt
Disney's World on Ice.
	   College has been put on hold for a while. The Olympics, well,
you just never know. But her dream of skating in the ice show
turned to reality.
	   The 18-year-old was cast in the title role of ``The Spirit of
Pocahontas,'' which opens today at the L.A. Sports Arena.
	   ``Skating with Walt Disney's World on Ice is a lot different
from skating competitively,'' Ng said. ``Basically, I'm skating for
thousands and thousands of people who judge me. On the amateur
level, I'm competing against other skaters and being judged by only
nine judges. This is a lot more fun. I have those thousands of
people right beside me. They're cheering and are so excited to see
Pocahontas.''
	   The $8 million ice show, which runs through April 6, also
features Sergei Petrovski as John Smith, Armen Saakian as Kocoum
and Larissa Zamotina as Nakoma. ``The Spirit of Pocahontas'' was
choreographed by Sarah Kawahara of Los Angeles. Other area
residents involved in the production are musical director Donn
Wilkerson of Sherman Oaks and skating director Cindy Stuart of Los
Angeles.
	   Ng's first brush with Pocahontas came after the animated film
was released in 1995.
	   ``After we saw it, my friends started commenting how I looked
like her,'' Ng recalled.
	   Now that she has the part, ``It's kind of weird,'' Ng said,
adding that she has seen the film countless times since then to
prepare for the ice show. ``Every time I see it, I love it more.''
	   Ng began skating when she was 5, following in the footsteps of
her older brother, Terry, now 21.
	   ``I used to totally idolize my brother, and I did everything he
did,'' she said. ``I just loved skating.''
	   Ng would get up at 4 a.m. for a 5 o'clock workout, go to school,
then skate afterward, often doing her homework in the car. In
between were ballet and jazz classes.
	   She attended local schools in the San Fernando Valley until her
junior and senior years, when she transferred to Rim of the World
High School in Lake Arrowhead to be closer to her training
facility.
	   Ng competed in the U.S. National Championships and won gold
medals in Skate Canada in 1990 and the Gardena Spring Trophy in
1992. She also skated for two years representing Taiwan in honor of
her heritage and her grandfather.
	   Ng was concentrating on heading off to college when she got a
call last year from Kawahara to audition for the ice show. She has
been touring with the company for eight months, averaging 10 shows
a week.
	   ``Doing this role has always been a challenge,'' Ng said.
``Every show is a different audience. Sometimes you have to work
harder. Sometimes the audience is really into it, sometimes you
bring them into it.''
	   The show has given her the opportunity to skate with a partner
for the first time, work with special effects and test her acting
ability.
	   ``This is what I love about performing and skating,'' Ng said.
``Now I'm able to act as well as skate. This is another dream come
true.''
