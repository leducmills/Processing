	   When he first saw Willie Mays play baseball, New York Giants
executive Garry Schumacher compared him to the most delightful
thing that popped into mind. ``He's the guy who'll keep us all
eating strawberries in the wintertime,'' he said. Life was berry,
berry good for the Giants indeed.
	   Like spring training, winter strawberries provide a taste of the
pleasures to come when the year reaches fruition in summer and
fall. Here are some suggestions on how to use the delicious little
harbingers:
	   DESSERT
	   Cross Creek Strawberry Shortcake
	   Makes 8 servings
	   Preparation time: 10 minutes
	   Cooking time: 20 minutes
	   The name shortcake has nothing to do with height. It refers to a
crisp biscuit cake made ``short'' by the use of shortening. Not
that Americans pay much attention to the distinction. At the
Parkesdale Farm Market in Plant City, Fla., manager Cheryl Meeks
noticed that Northerners prefer angel or poundcake under their
berries, while Southerners favor a more biscuitlike cake. She split
the difference by developing a compromise cake. Unfortunately, she
wouldn't reveal the recipe. So, instead, we offer this adaptation
of a Florida classic from ``Cross Creek Cookery,'' Marjorie Kinnan
Rawlings' 1942 cookbook.
	   2pounds strawberries, washed, hulled and sliced
	   2tablespoons brown sugar, or to taste
	   2cups unbleached all-purpose flour
	   2teaspoons baking powder
	   1teaspoon salt
	   6tablespoons granulated sugar, divided
	   5tablespoons very cold unsalted butter
	   1egg
	   2/3cup plus 1 tablespoon milk, divided
	   1/4teaspoon nutmeg, preferably freshly grated
	   1cup whipping cream
	   2tablespoons confectioners' sugar, or to taste
	   2tablespoons softened butter
	   Arrange an oven rack on the top position, preheat oven to 450
degrees and butter a 9-inch round cake pan. Combine the
strawberries with the brown sugar, reserving a few whole berries
for decoration, correct for sweetness and let the berries macerate.
	   Mix together the flour, baking powder, salt and 1/4 cup sugar.
With your fingertips, rub the cold butter into the flour mixture
until it clumps and resembles cornmeal. Make a well in the flour
mixture, add the egg and 2/3 cup milk and mix the liquids together.
Mix in the flour mixture to form a thick batter. Do not overmix.
	   Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, brush the top with 1
tablespoon milk and pat the cake out flat to fill the pan. Combine
the nutmeg and 2 tablespoons sugar, then sprinkle it over the
batter. Bake the shortcake on the top rack for 15 to 20 minutes or
until golden brown.
	   In the meantime, whip the cream with the confectioners' sugar
until soft peaks form. When the cake is ready, split it in half,
butter both halves with the soft butter, and place the bottom half
on a serving plate. Pour the strawberries and their juice over the
bottom half, place the top half of the cake over the strawberries,
cut into wedges and serve immediately with the whipped cream and
the whole strawberries as garnish.

	   Parkesdale Farms Strawberry Pecan Cookies
	   Makes 4 dozen 2 1/2 - to 3-inch cookies Preparation time: 25
minutes Cooking time: about 15 minutes per pan
	   These preciously pink cookies are another favorite at the
Parkesdale market. Happily, Cheryl was more forthcoming with this
recipe.
	   1 1/2cups granulated sugar
	   1cup shortening
	   1/2teaspoon baking soda
	   2large eggs beaten
	   3/4cup fresh strawberry puree (from 1 pint of berries)
	   3cups sifted all-purpose flour
	   1teaspoon salt
	   3/4cup chopped pecans
	   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In the large bowl of an electric
mixer, cream the sugar, shortening and soda; add eggs and
strawberry puree and mix just until blended. Stir in flour, salt
and pecans. Mix well. Drop by rounded tablespoonfuls onto greased
cookie sheets. Bake about 15 minutes per pan.

	   DESSERT

	   When Capt. John Smith first beheld American strawberries in
Virginia, he couldn't believe his good fortune. He described them
as ``fine and beautifull ... foure times bigger and better than
ours in England.'' Imagine what he would have said if he had tasted
something like this cake.
	   CAKE:
	   1/2cup vegetable oil
	   3large eggs
	   118.25-ounce package yellow cake mix

	   1cup butter, softened
	   1/2cup fresh strawberries, crushed
	   116-ounce box confectioners' sugar, sifted
	   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour three 8-inch round
cake pans.
	   In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine oil, eggs, cake
mix and gelatin. Mix on medium speed until smooth. Stir in
strawberries and water or juice. Pour into prepared pans and bake
for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool completely before frosting.
	   For frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine butter,
strawberries and confectioners' sugar. Beat until fluffy and the
right consistency for spreading.
	   When cake layers are cooled, spread the icing on the top and
sides of cake. . .
