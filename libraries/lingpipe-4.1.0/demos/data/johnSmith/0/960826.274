(Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
	   To see Virginia Beach as a resort city is to miss much of its
attraction. It is perhaps best known for its two-mile-long
boardwalk and oceanfront strip.
	   But Virginia Beach comes in other incarnations: Half of its vast
geographic area (a product of its merger with Princess Anne County)
remains rural, and historic and timeless places still survive.
	   It was here, in 1607, that colonists under Capt. John Smith
first set foot in North America before moving up the James River to
establish the permanent settlement at Jamestown.
	   And it was off Cape Henry, during the Revolutionary War, that
the French fleet under Adm. Francois Joseph Paul, compte de Grasse,
defeated the British, making possible the decisive victory at
Yorktown.
	   Tourism began in the 19th century, when the railroad linked
Virginia Beach to the nearby port city of Norfolk, but it wasn't
until the 1920s that the city took off, with the addition of the
boardwalk and the Cavalier Hotel , both of which are still here.
	   In 1963, the city merged with surrounding Princess Anne County,
allowing it to stretch 310 square miles from Chesapeake Bay to the
North Carolina border.
	   The city has been working hard to stay competitive in the resort
market. It has spruced up the resort strip some, made a major
addition to its already popular Virginia Marine Science Museum and
built an amphitheater that is attracting bigger acts to the area
since it opened in May.
	   Late summer and early fall are good times to visit. The crowds
are gone and many hotel rates drop after Labor Day. Temperatures
are mild (the ocean waters average 72 degrees in September), and
there's still plenty to do.
	   The area code for phone numbers in Virginia Beach is being
changed to 757 from 804. The change is not expected to be completed
until early next year.
EVENTS
	   Special events and festivals, a staple of summer beach life,
continue through September.
	   The granddaddy is the Neptune Festival, (804) 498-0215, now in
its 23d year. It runs from Sept. 15 to 29, and on the concluding
weekend, Sept. 27 to 29, will feature entertainment, arts and
crafts shows, a sand-castle competition, among other activities,
all centered along the oceanfront.
	   The American Music Festival, (804) 491-7866, is scheduled for
Aug. 30 to Sept. 2. Headliners , performing under the stars at
several stages along the beach , include Willie Nelson, Huey Lewis
and the News, the Temptations and the Four Tops. Admission is $10
for featured entertainers, free for other acts.
	   Some of the biggest happenings are at the new Virginia Beach
Amphitheater, 3550 Cellar Door Way, (804) 671-8100. Performers
scheduled at the 20,000-seat theater include James Taylor on
Friday; Melissa Etheridge, Aug. 28; Blues Traveler, Lenny Kravitz
and Rusted Root, Aug. 30. Ticket prices vary.
	   The Virginia Beach Center for the Arts, 2200 Parks Ave., (804)
425-0000, has three companion exhibits that focus on vessels (the
kind used as containers) from different points of view and in
different media.
	   Highlighting the shows, which run through Sept. 8, is ``John
Ruppert: Natural Forces/Urban Context,'' which features giant
chain-link vessels by Mr. Ruppert, a Baltimore sculptor.
	   The museum's permanent collection showcases 20th century art. It
is open Tuesday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5:30, Saturday from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. Free.
SIGHTSEEING
	   Virginia Beach boasts 38 miles of shoreline, 28 of which are
accessible to the public. There are 10 beaches, including ocean and
bay, boardwalk and beach community, bustling and quiet.
	   The action is along the resort strip, a crowded, noisy jumble of
hotels, restaurants, souvenir shops and honky-tonk attractions that
runs along the Atlantic for more than two miles from Rudee Inlet to
40th Street.
	   For more solitude, there's the North End beyond 40th Street, the
beach at Fort Story (open to the public only during the week) and
Little Island Park at Sandbridge, a barrier-island beach community
beyond the rural Pungo section.
	   Besides salt- and freshwater fishing and other water sports,
Virginia Beach offers hiking, biking and bird-watching in peaceful
natural preserves.
	   First Landing-Seashore State Park, 2500 Shore Drive, (804)
481-2131, offers 2,700 acres of beach, sand dunes and 500 species
of plants, including cypress, live oak and Spanish moss. Open from
8 a.m. to dusk; the visitor's center is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Admission is $2 a car on weekdays, and $3 on weekends and holidays.
	   Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, 4005 Sandpiper Road, (804)
721-2412, and adjacent False Cape State Park, 4001 Sandpiper Road,
(804) 426-7128, are remote refuges for migratory birds and other
wildlife. Back Bay has dunes, marsh and woodlands. It is open from
sunrise to sunset, with the visitor center open Monday through
Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. Admission is $4 a car, $2 for those biking or walking.
	   False Cape, a barrier spit separating Back Bay and the ocean,
has six miles of undisturbed beach and maritime forest. It is
accessible by hiking or biking through five miles of the Back Bay
refuge.
	   The area's natural resources are brought together in the
Virginia Marine Science Museum, 717 General Booth Blvd., (804)
437-4949. Most of the $35 million expansion is open, tripling the
size and adding a 300,000-gallon deep-sea aquarium with sharks, a
salt marsh preserve and an IMAX theater showing ``Into the Deep.''
	   The museum is open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily through Labor Day,
until 5 p.m. thereafter. Combination admission to the museum and
theater is $10.95, $9.95 for children.
	   Fort Story, an Army base on historic Cape Henry, features the
First Landing Cross, a granite memorial to the cross erected by the
Jamestown settlers when they first made landfall on April 26, 1607.
	   Nearby is also a monument to the Battle of the Capes, a naval
battle that helped end the Revolutionary War. Also in Fort Story is
the 1791 Old Cape Henry Lighthouse, (804) 422-9421. Open daily 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. through October. Admission $2, $1 for children.
	   Historic homes in the area include the Adam Thoroughgood House,
1636 Parrish Road, (804) 664-6283. Built around 1636, the four-room
farmhouse is one of the oldest brick homes in the country.
	   The house and grounds have been restored with 17th-century
furnishings and landscaping. Open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m., and Sunday, noon to 5 p.m.; cost is $3, $1.50 for
students.
