Pocahontas. G, 1995. Disney, $26.99.
	   ``Pocahontas'' has the video field pretty much to itself this
week. Mostly because Disney's competitors didn't dare go up against
the world's mightiest video maker.
	   Not a bad move on the part of Disney's rivals. Non-Disney titles
always get lost in the shuffle as moms and dads stampede stores to
be sure to have a Disney animated title the day of its release. If
they don't, there's heck to pay at home. Or so we've been told by
parents who should know.
	   ``Pocahontas'' was not the monster hit on the order of ``Beauty
and the Beast'' and ``The Lion King.'' Nonetheless, with a
suggested retail under $27 and real retail hovering around $15,
``Pocahontas'' is sure to join the non-stop parade of Disney
animated features that sell 10 million tapes or more.
	   Bolstering interest in the ``Pocahontas'' video is the Oscar
race. In what's becoming an annual event, Alan Menken along with
lyricist Stephen Schwartz was nominated for an Oscar for best
musical or comedy score and for best song, ``Colors of the Wind.''
	   That's the business side of ``Pocahontas.'' As for the film
itself, Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg's direction leaves a lot to
be desired. It was to be expected that liberties would be taken
with the story of the Powhatan princess (voice by Irene Bedard) who
saved Captain John Smith (voiced by Mel Gibson) from certain doom.
Playing with the facts is part and parcel of film-making.
	   What we don't understand is the inferior animation and
story-telling. After establishing new standards in animated realism
in ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The Lion King,'' Disney's
animators returned to a more stylized drawings in ``Pocahontas.''
The result is a highly angular look the harkens back to Disney's
lesser efforts of the early '60s to '70s, such as ``The Sword in
the Stone'' and ``Robin Hood.''
	   The little ones probably won't notice that ``Pocahontas'' is not
as strong as its recent predecessors. But their parents will.
	   So grown-ups, you have been forewarned. Those who found Disney
at its ground-breaking best in ``Aladdin,'' ``Beauty and the
Beast'' and ``The Lion King'' will find the company in less than
peak form in ``Pocahontas.''

Coming Out Under Fire. Unrated, 1994. Orion. Priced to rent.
	   With the military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy under fire,
this documentary about homosexual soldiers during World War II
takes on added weight. Director Arthur Dong asks nine gay and
lesbian veterans how it was to be homosexual and in the armed
forces.

Double Happiness.PG-13, 1995. New Line. Priced to rent.
	   Mina Shum makes an impressive directorial bow in this wry,
romantic comedy. Sandra Oh stars as a Chinese-Canadian who has
trouble breaking her family ties. Of course, she's not supposed to
until there's a prospective husband in her life. While mom and dad
look for a ``nice successful Chinese man,'' their daughter is
dating an Anglo in secret. A happy ending is forthcoming in this
film that will appeal to those who rented the videos of ``Eat Drink
Man Woman'' and ``The Wedding Banquet .''
