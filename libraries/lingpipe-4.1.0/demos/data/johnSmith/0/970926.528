
	   The American persimmon tree ``has received more criticism, both
adverse and favorable, than almost any known species,'' W.F.
Fletcher wrote for an Agriculture Department Farmers' Bulletin in
1915.
	   If your mouth has ever been puckered by an unripe American
persimmon, you know much of the reason for this adverse criticism.
The bad press goes back to the early 17th century, when Captain
John Smith, of Jamestown fame, wrote: ``If it is not ripe it will
draw a man's mouth awrie with much torment.'' In modern parlance, I
liken eating an unripe persimmon to having the business end of a
vacuum cleaner in my mouth , and the sensation lingers even after
spitting out the fruit.
	   Ah, but eating a ripened persimmon is as pleasurable as eating
an unripened one is horrible. Smith went on to say that ``when it
is ripe, it is as delicious as an apricot.''
	   In contrast to the larger, firmer Oriental persimmon found in
food markets, fruit of the American persimmon (Diospyros
virginiana) has the look and size of a cherry tomato, with a
similar range of color, from yellow to orange to deep red. When
ready to eat, an American persimmon is too soft to be a market
fruit but fine for backyards, where fruits need travel no more than
arm's length. At that point, the flesh has a richness and texture
akin to a wet, dried apricot with a dash of spice.
	   Differences between American and Oriental persimmon go beyond
the fruit. Cold tolerance, for example. American persimmon is
native from Connecticut to Florida and west to Kansas, and some
varieties tolerate Zone 4 winters, characteristic of Albany, N.Y.
	   Compared with its Oriental cousin, which has been improved by
centuries of breeding and selection, American persimmon is an
upstart. The first variety to be named was discovered in 1880 on a
farm in Alton, Ill. Early-ripening, flavorful and small, the seeded
Early Golden began a lineage of high-quality varieties that include
Garretson, Killen, John Rick and Meader. That 1915 bulletin listed
12 varieties.
	   Many wild persimmons never develop good flavor, so the first key
to enjoying persimmons is to plant a variety known to bear tasty
fruits. Grafted trees range in price from about $12 to $25. In the
Hudson Valley, near the northern limit for growing persimmons, I
choose varieties that can survive frigid winters, in addition to
being able to ripen fruit in a short growing season. Contrary to
lore, frost is not necessary to ripen a persimmon , nor will it.
What is needed is time. Szukis and Meader are varieties that ripen
fruits in the Northeast, even after temperatures plummet below
minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Other cold-hardy varieties that ripen
in short seasons are Hicks, Pieper, Dooley and Slate. They vary in
color and size.
	   There is one more wrinkle in selecting a persimmon variety ,
pollination. Wild trees and many cultivated varieties are either
male or female. To get fruit from a female, you have to rely on
nearby male wild trees for pollination, plant a male nearby or
graft a male branch onto a female tree.
	   Fortunately, not all females need males to set fruit. Some
female varieties accommodate gardeners by bearing occasional male
branches , a characteristic prevalent in Early Golden and its
offspring. And some females do not need pollination to set fruit,
which is then seedless. Varieties that can bear fruit in isolation
include Meader, Szukis, Early Golden, Florence and Garretson.
	   In contrast to many other fruits, persimmon is a low-maintenance
plant. I never need to spray my persimmons, and I prune them little
or not at all. Young trees benefit from occasional shortening or
removal of misplaced branches. But once fruit bearing begins,
usually three to four years after planting, persimmons become
somewhat self-pruning as they naturally drop some branches that
have borne fruit. What more could you ask for from a fruit tree?
	   Persimmon also is not particularly finicky as to site. The tree
tolerates a wide range of soils, except those that are waterlogged.
It must have at least a half day of sunshine to fruit well. As a
tree matures, sprouts originating from the roots may appear five
feet or more from the parent plant. This suckering habit caused
farmers at the turn of the century to curse the plant as it spread
into their fields, but it is not a problem in mown lawn. And lawn
is a good place for a persimmon tree, since some varieties drop
their fruit when it is ripe and it can then plummet to the ground
intact.
	   Persimmons grow to 50 feet or higher but are never imposing.
Drooping leaves and branches , particularly when bearing the weight
of fruit , give the tree a relaxed, languid appearance. A bluish
cast to the leaves enhances the soft look. The checkered pattern of
the bark makes the trunk seem wrapped in alligator hide (droll, not
frightening).
	   Through much of the year, the persimmon is an asset to the
landscape. My trees' leaves stay prim through summer's end, when
those of most other plants look battered by wind, rain and insect
forays. Come fall, the tree's languid appearance is livened by the
bright fruits ripening among the lush leaves. Autumn color can be
spectacular, with leaves anywhere from clear yellow to crimson,
depending on the variety.
	   Even after leaves have dropped, fruits of some varieties ,
Szukis, for example , cling to branches, festooning the leafless
trees like Christmas ornaments. I eat some persimmons as they
ripen; others I let hang on the branches to be plucked at my
pleasure through the fall.
