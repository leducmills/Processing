	   His name was Antonio. He was a young Latino man who walked with
his shoulders slouched and his head bowed. He was just one of
hundreds of men who passed through a New York homeless shelter, but
Janice Harris-Corry noticed him.
	   ``He was the type of person you wanted to protect,'' she said.
``He was happy-go-lucky in a child's way. You knew it would be easy
for him to get lost in the system.''
	   Harris-Corry, now director of the Moreland Avenue Shelter, had
just begun working with the homeless when she met Antonio in 1984.
	   ``I was very new,'' she recalled. ``I thought I could do a lot
more than I could.''
	   Antonio became her personal project. He suffered from a mental
disorder that caused him to function at a child's level.
Harris-Corry took him to a hospital to receive a physical and
mental evaluation. One day Antonio decided to repay Harris-Corry.
He came into her office and announced that he wanted to give her
something. He pulled a battered jewelry box from his pocket, opened
it, and gently pulled back some tissue. Then Antonio handed
Harris-Corry a tiny figurine , a yellow bear with fins for feet.
	   Harris-Corry peered at the curious object in her hand.
	   ``I don't know what it is, but I'll take it,'' she said.
	   Antonio told Harris-Corry that not many people were nice to him,
but she was. He carried Kemi everywhere. Now he wanted her to keep
Kemi.
	   Harris-Corry had found an ``icon of hope.''
	   A month later Antonio disappeared. Harris-Corry never saw him
again.
	   But Harris-Corry had Kemi, her icon. It has become a symbol of
gratitude. It lifts her spirits when the people she helps seem
ungrateful.


 Fred Dresch
 TV/film director
 Icon of hope: Staurolite crystals

	   A verse from the Psalms says: ``The heavens declare the glory of
God!'' So does the earth, Fred Dresch discovered.
	   Dresch has an eye for art. He is a musician and currently a
television and film director. On Sunday, his raspy baritone fills
up the small Presbyterian church he attends in suburban Decatur.
	   But Dresch also likes to get dirty. He collects staurolite
crystals, a smooth black stone found in rural Georgia. Dresch often
scours Georgia hillsides on his hands and feet, looking for the
elusive stones. He is enchanted by the legend that surrounds them.
	   According to legend, the crystals were formed when God sent the
stone crosses down as rain to remind people of his power. The myth
said that God spoke above the rain: ``I am the soul in all that
lives.''
	   The Cherokee also thought the crystals would protect a person's
health. One story suggests that Pocahontas took the stone from her
necklace and gave it to John Smith, saving his life.
	   ``It's traditionally considered a good luck piece,'' Dresch
said. ``I almost always have one somewhere, either in one of my
bags or in my pocket.''
	   The shape of staurolite crystals fascinates Dresch. They look
like crosses. These crystals have become his ``icons of hope.''
	   ``It's unbelievable that this could occur naturally,'' Dresch
said about the stones. ``It always reminds me that the hand of God
is in everything.''


 Amy Richter
 Case manager for AID Atlanta
 Icon of hope: Her ``happy wall''

	   When Amy Richter, a 1991 graduate of Emory University, decided
to attend a class reunion, she became a conversation stopper.
	   As she made her way through the crowd, people asked one another
what they now did for a living. Richter told her classmates she
worked with the dying. She was a case manager for AID Atlanta.
	   ``They would say, 'Oh, how noble,' and then kind of slink
away,'' Richter said, laughing. ``I was the only one who wasn't a
doctor or a lawyer.''
	   In a culture that worships youth, the subject of death renders
many people mute. This cultural aversion to death is even more
pronounced with the mention of AIDS.
	   Richter's personality, fast-talking and bubbly , does not match
the grim nature of her job. She currently manages the cases of 92
AIDS sufferers.
	   It is emotionally brutal work. Richter finds ways to cope.
Sometimes she sweats the sadness out. A workout fanatic, she'll go
to the gym four times a week. Other times, she'll go to the video
store.
	   ``I'll go get a cry movie and cry it out,'' she said.
	   When that does not work, Richter looks at her ``happy wall'' in
her office that she has decorated with various ``icons of hope'':
thank-you notes from her clients, postcards, inspirational poems.
	   Richter looks at the wall when she gets depressed.
	   ``It tends to stop me from wallowing,'' she said.
	   The notes of gratitude from clients move Richter the most. Her
classmates may find her work noble, but some clients never thank
her. Many are too overwhelmed by their suffering to think of
Richter.
	   But those that do make it to her happy wall. As she sat in her
office one morning, Richter looked at the wall and smiled.
	   ``It's just nice to hear thank you once in a while.''
