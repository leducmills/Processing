	   PHOENIX - Disney films are famous for their happy endings,
although there have been a few exceptions.
	   Bambi's mother never made it.
	   Old Yeller was put to sleep.
	   Capt. John Smith took a bullet in Pocahontas, too, and had to go
back to England.
	   But what about ``D4'' , the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim?
	   The Ducks, owned by the Walt Disney Co., are one game away from
being eliminated from the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Coyotes. If
Phoenix wins today at America West Arena in Game 6 of this
best-of-seven Western Conference first-round series, Anaheim is a
dead duck.
	   So be it, Coyotes assistant captain Kris King says.
	   ``When you get a team down, for lack of a better term, you gotta
kick 'em,'' King said. ``That's pretty much how we have to start
the game: Jump on them early and never let them back up again.''
	   The Coyotes, who have won three straight against the Ducks after
dropping the first two games of the series in Anaheim, don't want
to go back to California for a rewrite in Game 7.
	   To avoid that, they will have to win three straight at home for
the first time all season. And, once again, they will need to put
some muscle on the Mighty Ducks' top two scorers, Teemu Selanne and
Paul Kariya, who have taken more hits in this series than Rocky
Balboa did in the movies.
	   Selanne and Kariya have accounted for eight of the Mighty Ducks'
11 goals, making them obvious targets to receive more tight
checking today. In the past three games, however, they have been
neutralized. Kariya has one goal, Selanne two.
	   ``We just have to keep doing what we've been doing, playing good
defense and making sure those two guys don't get a lot of room to
skate,'' said Coyotes defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, who ignited the
series with inflammatory comments about the Ducks, his former team.
	   If the Coyotes successfully contain Selanne and Kariya, then
Game 7 probably won't be necessary. The Mighty Ducks haven't gotten
a single goal from any of their other forwards in five games. The
Coyotes, meanwhile, have gotten five from front-line players other
than Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick.
	   ``They have to have people step up, just like any other team.
It's the playoffs,'' said Roenick, who has two goals and four
assists. ``Like I've said before, you have to do things that are
uncharacteristic to win during the playoffs , blocking shots,
defensive play, scoring goals when you get the chance.''
	   If the Coyotes win today, they will advance beyond the first
round for only the third time in the franchise's 18-year history.
	   Depending on the outcome of other playoff series, they could
open the conference semifinals on the road at Colorado, Dallas or
Detroit, or at home against Edmonton, St. Louis or Chicago.
	   But it's pointless if the Coyotes lose today and have to start
California dreamin' on Tuesday in a Game 7.
	   ``I don't think anybody is thinking about the second round
yet,'' Roenick said. ``We have to make sure we dispose of this
round first.''
	   If they don't, and the Coyotes lose this series to the Mighty
Ducks, the volatile Tkachuk will explode, he said.
	   ``If we lose in the first round, it's a (expletive)
disappointing season,'' said Tkachuk, who scored an NHL-high 52
goals during the regular season and has five in the playoffs. ``I
don't care what happened during the year, even if we finished first
overall and had over 100 points.
	   ``If we lose this series, I'll be (expletive) miserable all
(expletive) year.''
	   The Mighty Ducks, in the playoffs for the first time, know what
is at stake for them, too.
	   ``We played down the stretch like every game is a must-win game,
but we haven't played that way in the last three,'' Kariya said.
``It's almost like we need that pressure. We felt it was do or die
many times when it actually wasn't. Now, it's do or die.''
	   The team that scores first likely will win. It has happened in
four of the five games. The Coyotes are 28-0-1 when leading after
the first period, a fact not lost on Anaheim Coach Ron Wilson.
	   ``They're going to come out emotional. Their crowd will really
support them,'' he said. ``We have to bend but not break in the
first 10 minutes. We've got to make sure they don't gain momentum
in the first period.''
