	   Asked recently about dependents of Department of Defense
civilians remaining in Kuwait, Gen. John M. (for Malchese)
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Army
Times: ``The vast majority, if not all, are on a long accompanied
tour. We're going to neck that down to those that are absolutely
necessary.''
	   The ever-vigilant Joseph C. Goulden of Accuracy in Media sent in
that clip and noted: ``When I was a slip of a lad in rural East
Texas, `neck' was something you did with a nubile maiden at the Fox
Drive-In Theater, or on a blanket in a pine copse at Scout Lake.
Pray tell where the Hon. Shali found this term, and how it got into
military speak.''
	   Perhaps A.I.M. is reluctant to slam the top brass against the
wall about their usage, but on such matters this former corporal
has a tradition of fearlessness verging on the foolhardy. I put it
to the general: What's with neck down?
	   ``It is possible that I first heard the term neck down as an
artillery officer,'' the man known as General Shali responded
cheerfully, despite having been calumniated as ``General
Shilly-Shally'' by this columnist writing in another space last
year. ``However, the phrase is actually used by both military and
civilian shooters. Necking down is the practice of reducing the
diameter of a cartridge case at its neck, allowing a smaller
diameter bullet to be fired from it. This is frequently done to
increase the velocity of the projectile.''
	   The JCS chairman, an immigrant from Poland who ``learned English
from the silver screen under the expert tutelage of John Wayne,''
directs us to ``ABCs of Reloading,'' by Dean A. Grennell, for
pictures of cartridges going through a necking down.
	   Etymology unsupported by the Pentagon confirms the general's
definition. Mitford M. Mathews, in his 1951 Dictionary of
Americanisms, defines neck in an 1812 citation as ``to cut the
neck (i.e., the excrescence at the point where the lead was
poured into the mold) off an old-fashioned round bullet for a
muzzle-loading rifle.'' The OED has a 1938 use from a metallurgical
text: ``The contraction begins to concentrate at some one point on
the bar, (and) the piece begins to neck down.''
	   ``The phrase has also crept into the civilian lexicon,'' notes
the general, zeroing in, as riflemen say, on the extended metaphor
of interest to lexicographers, ``meaning `a reduction to increase
efficiency.' Good examples might be to neck down a lengthy column
 or in my case, this letter.''
	   Because Shali had in his cross hairs the readers of a
publication directed at members of the armed forces, he could be
confident that his figure of speech would be understood. Corporate
executives seeking a synonym for downsizing less euphemistic than
``work-force imbalance correction'' might strike a Patton-esque
pose and say, ``Sorry, old-timer, but this place needs a necking
down.''
	   As for the media watchdog Mr. Goulden, happily entwined in his
memory with a nubile maiden on a blanket in East Texas, the slang
verb to neck as ``to indulge in amorous caresses,'' which dates
from 1910, is now obsolete, gone with sparking, spooning,
courting and petting. (Nubile, from the Latin nubere, ``to
marry,'' once meant ``marriageable'' but now usually means ``young
and sexy.'')
	   What do we now call a combination of kissing, stroking and
fondling , with hands outside the clothes , punctuated with sighs
and moans, all in the spirit of affectionate fun? In the '80s, the
odious sucking face held sway, and that self-mockery is
perpetuated with today's swapping spit, but a note of
sportsmanship has been added with boxing tonsils and tonsil
hockey.
Mugging (which dates back to 1821 in England),mauling 
(without a violent connotation) and grubbing are current, along
with going for sushi, based on ``tongue sushi,'' a mutual
rolling-up of tongues, which seems anatomically difficult.
	   Recently the most popular national usage has been necking down
to hooking up, which retains a kind of innocence, though this
department will entertain competing regional entries for what used
to be light petting. Just about everything else comes under
having sex.

	   Rig That Jury, Jerry

	   Today we are going to straighten out, once and for all,
jury-rigged, jerry-built and the confusing blend, jerry-rigged.
	   ``They [the Iraqis) are trying to jury-rig SAMs,'' a Pentagon
official was quoted about the replacement of surface-to-air
missiles damaged by U.S. attacks, `` . . . with radars to make them
operational.''
	   Steve Johnson of MSNBC's on-line service writes: ``I'm assuming
he meant that they were being fixed on a temporary or emergency
basis. But he could have meant that the SAM's were rebuilt in a
cheap manner, for which the phrase would be jerry-built. Are the
two phrases of common origin?''
	   Old salts know that a jury mast  is hastily put up to replace
a mast that has been broken or swept away. The origin of this
phrase, first used in print by Capt. John Smith in 1616, is
obscure; logic suggests a clip of injury, but no citation support
can be found.
	   In Herman Melville's 1851 novel ``Moby Dick,'' Captain Peleg
describes what he and Ahab did when their ship lost three masts in
a typhoon: ``Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and
how to save all hands , how to rig jury-masts.'' The meaning is
clearly ``makeshift,'' a temporary contrivance for use in an
emergency.
Jerry-built, first spotted in 1869, may be a corruption of
jury, or a reference to Jeremiah or Jericho. When panning a
musical in 1994, the New York Times critic David Richards wrote,
``The jerry-built book by Mr. King and Mr. Masterson is just a
series of stillborn sketches.'' The meaning is ``slapped together,
rickety,'' same as jury-rigged, but while the jury-rigging is
admirable in a storm, the jerry-building is always pejorative.
	   Nice difference in meaning, no? If you agree, avoid
jerry-rigged, which has been popping up lately, and jury-built,
which has not yet appeared but will soon. They fuzz the distinction
between the shipshape jury-rigged and the shoddy jerry-built.
(And if you're complaining about a verdict, say the jury was
tampered with rather than rigged, if only to keep things
clear.)
