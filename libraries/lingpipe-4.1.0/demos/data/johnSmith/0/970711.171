
	   CHICAGO , I did not mean to come here today.
	   But a comedy of airline (and, yes, passenger) errors led to my
flying home to Kansas City from Virginia through the Windy City
instead of Atlanta.
	   This is an amazing thing. Think about it. Today speed and
technology let us do something our Founding Fathers never dreamed
of being able to do , make a tiny mistake that can fling us
thousands of miles out of the way in a matter of hours or even
seconds, either in person or by phone, fax or e-mail.
	   I'm here at the zooey O'Hare International Airport (named, as
you know, after an Irish rabbit), thinking about our Founding
Fathers because I've just spent several days in Virginia at such
historic early American sites as Jamestown, Colonial Williamsburg
and Virginia Beach, one of the first beaches in America where Capt.
John Smith caught some rays.
	   I was in Williamsburg for the 20th annual convention of the
National Society of Newspaper Columnists, an organization that
contains not a single normal person. It is full of people who, when
they mean to go to Atlanta but end up in Chicago, don't say,
``Damn, what a waste!'' Rather, they say, ``I bet I can pull a
column out of this screw-up.'' They're perverse.
	   Anyway, it's clear to me, having just seen where the first
English settlers and the American revolutionists hung out three or
four centuries ago that today we are capable of much larger
mistakes than were, say, Thomas Jefferson or George Washington. Oh,
I know that if you go back 500-plus years you find Christopher
Columbus intending to sail to the East Indies or somewhere but
ending up in a parking lot in New Jersey, or wherever. But the
difference between then and now is speed.
	   It took Columbus months to pull off his bone-headed move. Me? I
aimed for Atlanta and wound up in Chicago in a matter of hours
simply by missing a plane because I was at the wrong airport.
(Don't ask.)
	   As we approach the end of the 20th century, we not only can make
huge mistakes, we can make them instantaneously. How often, for
instance, have you tried to call a friend's phone here in Chicago's
312 area code but dialed wrong and reached some bagel repair shop
in New York City's 212 area code?
	   It happens every day. (In fact, that bagel repair shop owner is
sick of it, I can tell you.) One small slip of a dialing digit
bounces us 1,000 miles to the east. Imagine that.
	   When Ben Franklin messed up by putting his finger a quarter-inch
from where he meant to put it, it meant only that he got it caught
in a printing press. There is simply no evidence that Franklin,
trying to call home to Philadelphia's 215 area code, ever got
bounced to San Francisco's 415 area because he messed up while
dialing.
	   But several centuries after Pocahontas worked out her residual
royalty deal with the Someday We'll Be the Walt Disney Co., we are
able to miss-send our words by e-mail just by typing
doofus(at)aol.com instead of doofus2(at)aol.com.
	   Mr. Doofus, who has never heard of us, gets puzzling notes from
us at his log condo in Idaho, while Mr. Doofus2, alone in his
retirement tent in Norfolk, Va., where I flew in from today,
wonders why he hasn't heard from us.
	   It's a 2,000-plus mile mistake that we made in a nanosecond, one
it would have taken Daniel Boone, say, weeks or even months to
complete via snailmail. In fact, I bet that some of Daniel Boone's
mail hasn't been delivered yet.
	   Well, I gotta run. My flight's being called. And with the way my
day's been going, I need to get my head prepared for the flight to
Kansas City to drop me off in Wyoming.
