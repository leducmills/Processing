
	   LONDON , Death, or at least a nostalgia for the dead, seems to
be enjoying a renaissance in Britain these days. Or maybe it's just
undergoing a commercial vogue.
	   Wherever you look, it seems that dead people are back in the
news, singing songs, selling products, attracting admirers, and
even , in one macabre case , turning up alive.
	   Perhaps Thanatos as trend-setter began last year with a
market-niche item for the smoker who refuses to be cowed , a
cigarette called Death in a black and white package that gets right
to the point with a skull and crossbones logo. They have turned up
at fashionable shops and restaurants all over town, though
opposition from the tobacco industry has now made them hard to
find.
	   Or perhaps the trend began with the Beatles recordings in which
the three survivors superimpose vocal harmonies over John Lennon's
voice in ``Free as a Bird'' and ``Real Love'' , all part of a Fab
Four extravaganza of six-hour documentary, compact disks, and home
videos to bring Apple Records some $130 million this year.
	   Another icon of the '60s, Che Guevara, has been turned into a
capitalist tool 28 years after he was gunned down in Bolivia. The
revolutionary whose portrait was a staple of college dormitory
walls and unwashed T-shirts , rugged, ragged, and bearded beneath
the lonestar beret , is now being used to sell everything from
shoes to neckties.
	   ``Che Guevara was very trendy this year,'' said Beatrice Howald,
a spokesman for SMH, the Swiss company that produces Swatch
watches. ``When our designers think up new models, they just follow
fashion.''
	   Swatch's Che watch, whose face is his face against a crimson
background, has been a top seller. SMH refuses to say how many have
been sold but confirms that sales were helped by a Cuban government
order for 10,000.
	   But the Cuban government, which uses Che's image for a variety
of dishes and knicknacks, is not at all pleased about another
venture, the sale here of a British-brewed beer called Che. It has
sold about 40,000 bottles at two dozen bars in London, under the
motto ``Banned in the U.S.A. It must be good'' , a reference to
U.S. sanctions that would presumably keep out a citrus additive
from Havana, the sole Cuban ingredient.
	   ``The motto reinforces its rather rebellious image,'' observed
Joe Grahame, the 27-year-old former investment banker who thought
up the beer during a series of visits to Cuba. The beer's appeal,
he theorized, ``has something to do with the post-'80s feeling that
it's not all money.''
	   Havana reportedly disagrees, feeling that the enterprise smacks
of exploitation.
	   Walt Disney's magic wand has revived interest in another
deceased legend. The film ``Pocahontas'' has added to the steady
flow of visitors to the beautiful brick-and-stone church of St.
George's in Gravesend, a quiet town on the Thames east of London.
For it is there , somewhere under the floor, perhaps in the chancel
 that she is buried.
	   This will come as news to anyone whose information on the maiden
that befriended the first English settlers comes from the film,
since it omits any mention of her travels to England, where she was
presented to the court of James I, and of her death from illness
almost as soon as she boarded a vessel for home. (Nor does the
movie mention that she ran into John Smith here and was put out to
find that he was still alive.)
	   ``For a while we were getting 1,000 people a week through the
church,'' said David Willey, the rector. ``From America, Canada,
the States, Australia. You could tell where the film was premiering
because of where the phone calls came from.''
	   Residents say that Disney has donated some $15,000 for equipment
to floodlight the church and hope that the tourist trade may be a
mini-boom for local shops. In September, there is a ``Pocahontas
Day'' for school children who dress up in costume and construct
what the rector called ``a Christian totem pole'' out of cardboard.
	   In terms of sheer draw, however, Pocahontas can't hold a candle
to a novelist who died a mere 178 years ago and whose works are
currently seen in a six-part BBC television series and half a dozen
movies. ``Austen fever'' is sweeping Britain, and so it's to be
expected that much of the contagion centers upon Chawton Cottage in
Hampshire, where she spent the last eight years of her life.
	   ``Normally, we see 20,000 people a year,'' said Tom Carpenter, a
trustee of the Jane Austen House museum. ``This year, it's quite a
leap , 28,000. She's at the top of the list, the head of the
race.''
	   ``And you know what we've noticed?'' he continued. ``It's not
just the committed Jane Austen audience, which is large; it's the
add-ons , 9-, 10-, 11-year-olds, even the beer-drinking, rugby-type
of macho male , everybody's going for her books.''
	   Why? ``No one uses bad language. There's no overt sex. There's
no violence. And no one loses a life unnecessarily. Yet those four
ingredients are assumed to be endemic to any plot today. In a
nutshell, what you've got in Jane Austen in a single package is
comedy, satire, romance, and drama. Her novels were expected to be
read around the family fireside. They're the equivalent of TV
today.''
	   The vogue has not hurt the cash register in the gift shop, where
Jane Austen tea towels, sweatshirts, dishes, cookbooks, and
everything else are gobbled up, with sales mushrooming from
$100,000 to roughly $150,000 a year.
	   A final resting place for another legend, Anna Pavlova, the
Russian ballerina who spent her final years in London, may be less
than secure. The author of a new biography, Jean Thomassen, asserts
that her dying wish was to return to her ``beloved Russia'' after
death.
	   For 65 years, Ms. Pavlova's ashes have been in a white urn at
Golder's Green cemetery, where they are likely to remain according
to a director of the crematorium. Others in the cemetery include
Sigumund Freud and Peter Sellars.
	   Sellars, had he been alive, might well have found inspiration in
the story of a 61-year-old woman in Cambridgeshire who took some
pills in what she later said was a suicide attempt, fell into a
deep sleep, and was pronounced dead by a doctor in the early
morning hours of New Year's Eve. Laid out on a mortuary slab, she
astounded the mortuary staff when she started snoring. She has been
a press celebrity ever since.
