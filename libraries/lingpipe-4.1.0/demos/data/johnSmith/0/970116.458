
	   NEW YORK , Tomorrow's women turned out in force Wednesday night
at Madison Square Garden to greet their heroine Pocahontas.
	   In her latest incarnation, the courageous and spirited
17th-century proponent of peace and intercultural harmony between
the Virginia colonists and her Indian tribe is on tour as the star
of ``The Spirit of Pocahontas,'' an ice show version of the popular
1995 Walt Disney animated film ``Pocahontas.''
	   Little girls predominated in the crowd that greeted the start of
the Garden engagement, which runs through Sunday. Then the show
will pack skates, muskets, dugouts and forest to move to the
Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., from Tuesday
through Jan. 26, and to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in
Uniondale, N.Y., from Jan. 28 through Feb. 2.
	   Typically, this is another handsome Kenneth Feld Walt Disney
World on Ice production, with attractive skaters, colorful costumes
and lavish props, lighting and special effects that range from mist
to fluttering leaves.
	   But truth to tell, as source material, ``Pocahontas,'' for all
its good intentions, is far from the best of the Disney animated
films.
	   As romantic leads, the Indian maiden Pocahontas and John Smith,
the stalwart English adventurer, possess less chemistry than the
average loaf of white bread; the plot stirred by the greedy,
gold-seeking Governor Ratcliffe never generates much suspense or
credible conflict, and most of the fun is provided by Pocahontas'
pals, the mischievous raccoon Meeko and his needle-beaked
hummingbird sidekick, Flit.
	   In the transfer from the unfettered fantasy of animation to the
icebound realm of ``The Spirit of Pocahontas,'' Meeko becomes
merely a bustling busybody and Flit a bird on a wire who rightly
vanishes after a token appearance.
	   Still, there are the pleasures of the Oscar-winning Alan
Menken-Stephen Schwartz score, with the hit song ``Colors of the
Wind''; the smoothly working props, from ships and dugouts to that
woodland yenta, Grandmother Willow, the talking tree; and, of
course, the legions of skaters , Virginia colonists, Indians,
spirits and animals , choreographed by Sarah Kawaraha.
	   Although Mickey and Minnie Mouse (was someone expecting Alistair
Cooke?) provide the introduction to the show, Grandmother Willow
serves as its sermonizing narrator. And acrobatic skaters doing
stunts on teeterboards and trampolines provide a touch of circus to
the entertainment.
	   By and large, the skating solos and duets outshine the ensemble
numbers; and in Joanna Ng, the show is blessed with a graceful and
alluring heroine. Among the men, Armen Saakian as Kocoum, the
bravest of Chief Powhatan's braves, turns in a virtuoso skating
performance.
	   Children love twice-told tales. Those who harbor fond memories
of ``Pocahontas'' from 1995, or from more recent viewings of the
film as part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection on
videotape, will doubtless find in the ice version a comforting
opportunity for reunion with its admirable heroine, its worthy
sentiments and its award-winning music.
