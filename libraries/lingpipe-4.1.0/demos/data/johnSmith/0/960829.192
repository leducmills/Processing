	   A whole new crop of 5-year-olds, mine among them, started
kindergarten Wednesday. This, of course, is a long-awaited event
which, on the miracle scale, ranks right up there with childbirth
itself.
	   The children were fine; the moms and dads were a collective
wreck. Which is precisely why God made us parents and them
children. We're fearful. They're gleeful.
	   We have sense. They don't.
	   Grownups know that this day means more than just crayons and
cafeterias and pretty teachers named Mrs. Levine. This is the day
the windows of the world are flung wide open, never to close again.
	   Here in this big classroom , full of potential lifelong friends
and the bullies that until now have lived only in storybooks , is
all the promise and prejudice we've only hinted at. Here are all
the things we have spent five years preparing them for, and hoping
they'd never have to deal with.
	   In the weeks prior to The Big Day, I spent countless hours
talking to countless friends whose children were about to fly the
coop as well.
	   ``It'll be January before she talks to anyone,'' worried one.
	   ``I hope he doesn't have an accident the first day,'' said
another.
	   ``I'm having a heart attack,'' said I.
	   But then, the day arrived and , toting backpacks bigger than
their entire backs , our 5-year-olds trooped into this brand-new
world with all the bravado of John Smith and Pocahontas combined.
	   ``Mom,'' said my son in a whisper five minutes after he'd
arrived. ``I love it already! We're gonna learn all about space!''
	   I was glad for him, really I was, but would it kill him to shed
a tear or two?
	   Nancy Bivona was up at the crack of dawn on Day One, her stomach
all aflutter. She made it through breakfast and got the kids , Ana,
5, and Katie, 3 , dressed. But as she walked down the path to
school, rain spilling all around her, she choked up.
	   ``You just wonder, are they going to make friends? Are they
going to get along?'' she worried. (Ana hurried home six hours
later to inform Bivona that school is wonderful, and please, mom,
she'd prefer to ride the bus from now on.)
	   Yadi Cox stood outside her son's room Wednesday morning,
mesmerized. She knew she had to leave. There was another son to get
to school, a husband to kiss goodbye. She had to get to work, for
heaven's sake.
	   But there, on the other side of that big, heavy door, sat her
little Alexander. Her baby. Never again in all her life would she
have a child this small, this needy, this sweet, to care for.
	   Never again would she stand outside a kindergarten classroom
with her heart about to break. So she just stood there and stared
at her small son.
	   Would he find playmates easily? Get his feelings hurt on the
very first day? Would he miss his mom as much as she already is
missing him?
	   ``Mom,'' Cox's older son, a very worldwise 12, practically
wailed at her. ``He's gonna be fine.''
	   I'm just guessing here, but perhaps that's exactly what Yadi Cox
is afraid of.
	   So here we go. Another notch in the belt. No more preschool
pandering. No more Miss Mary to pop in the straw on the juice box.
It's time for them to open those Tupperware containers all by
themselves.
	   And in the evening, when the stream-of-consciousness dinner
conversation begins, it is wonderful to be reminded of just how
lovely and pure this world looks when you're 5.
	   ``Dad, I found a secret water fountain,'' my son whispers in the
strictest of confidence. He is horrified to report that Oscar got a
timeout because he wouldn't put his head on the table at rest time.
And please, will someone tell him: What is that voice that keeps
coming through the walls?
	   Which just proves my point.
	   You can potty train them. You can teach them to use a napkin.
You can sternly advise that the words ``please'' and ``thank you''
are mandatory, not optional.
	   But you can't think of everything.
	   My kid's going to have to figure out the P.A. system all by
himself.
