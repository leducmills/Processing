	   I loved the fireplace as a boy, the sunset glow of its copper
hood with the embossed legend, ``If You Be Here a Friend You Needs
Must Be'' , Chaucerian English, my parents said , and how firelight
dappled the cottage's beams, hewn logs, ladder stairs and iron
window screens, creating a mood of unreality. We called our cottage
the Gatehouse, as it secured the foot of a modest driveway rising
to a larger house, our residence, which overlooked the Potomac.
	   Both structures, of whitewashed logs with red and blue trim,
held elfin charm for a 6-year-old. The roofs were steeply pitched,
their hand-split log shingles curling toward medieval chimneys. Two
log well houses, dank and mossy, stood in the yard like troll
hutches among the dogwoods.
	   It was 1951, and our family had left Washington for Cabin John,
Md., a rural enclave that had been a barge stop on the Chesapeake &
Ohio Canal. Both houses were owned by a retired Marine Corps major,
of Cheyenne, Wyo., who'd run a bit of rum during Prohibition, and
his wife, of Philadelphia Cream Cheese, an artist. Major Riner had
known Buffalo Bill. After cocktails, he'd reminisce, firing his
Luger at the stars. Mrs. Riner knew Bess Truman, the president's
wife, whose limousine often idled before the antique shop Mrs.
Riner and my mother kept.
	   Cabin John, nicknamed Dogpatch, was an odd quarter for an
antiques shop. But its location near the Potomac glens was draw
enough. The 15-minute drive from Washington, following MacArthur
Boulevard west toward Great Falls, was legendary for its beauty.
Some believe the town's name commemorated John Smith, who in 1608
explored the river to Little Falls. Others say it was named for a
decrepit settler, John of the Cabin, a pirate who'd buried his
treasure in Cabin John. My prep school classmates dubbed it Common
John. The antiques sold well.
	   In 1953 the Riners offered both their houses to us for $30,000
on condition that they might remain in the Gatehouse and that my
father, a physician, treat them gratis. My parents accepted. I
became a hillbilly, fishing and hunting with those countrymen who
squatted by the canal, and later tippling with the major.
	   I moved into the Gatehouse in October 1969. I was completing my
first book, terrified that I'd fail. Each morning I built a little
fire and wrote greedily. The cottage was designed for work, as
Rocky Wood , architect of both houses , had used it for his studio.
With wide skylights and heavy forge (he wrought the iron screens,
latches, hasps, lanterns and fireplace implements there), it was
provocative and stimulating. My mother decorated it with the
antiques I use today.
	   As time passed, I became fascinated by the Gatehouse's
architect. I studied Wood's ironwork, especially the window screen
with its nightmare gargoyles taunting the happy bass and robins. It
seemed a grim metaphor, a caution against my fairy-tale reverie.
Was this Freud's bone to pick with Victorian sentimentality?
Twain's bedevilment with Romanticism? Breuer's disgust with
Gothicism? Who was Rocky Wood?
	   One night I opened a dusty novel and found his resume stuck
inside, hand illustrated and packaged like a thriller: ``The Case
of a Bloomin' Architect.''
	   Roscoe Larue Wood was born in Indiana in 1903. He studied
architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with
Ralph Adams Cram, the tireless proponent of Gothicism and medieval
thought. He worked for Cram and later broke with him to build his
own forge at the University of Michigan. He then traveled through
Europe, lingering in Sweden, where he studied sculpture at its
Royal Academy and worked with copper. By 1935 he'd built several
houses in Washington and had won a fellowship to study modern
design at Columbia University. In 1937 he built what he called his
``own house of logs on the Potomac.''
	   The plan was more complicated than that sounds. He'd been
impressed by the log architecture of Sweden, but in this little
essay he said he wished his houses to be ``ultra modern in respect
to planning, using all manner of new materials, yet combining them
with logs, hand-woven fabrics, wrought iron and all that host of
primitive materials, which seem to be lost in the streamlined,
mechanized modernism.'' Plus they had to have what Cram called
``spirituality for the technological age.''
