
	   On May 13, 1607, the first successful English settlement in what
is now the United States got off to an unsteady start at a swampy
island in a broad tidal river. The 104 settlers of the Virginia
Company named the place James Fort, later Jamestown, after the
sovereign more than half of them would die serving in a few
wretched months.
	   This was the colony where Capt. John Smith made his name in
history and Pocahontas, a young daughter of the powerful Indian
chief Powhatan, became a legend befriending the beleaguered English
and supposedly rescuing Smith from death.
	   Looking back from the 19th century, the orator Edward Everett
spoke of the Jamestown fort in tidewater Virginia as the place
``where the first germs of the mighty republic ... were planted.''
	   All traces of the original fort, however, had been lost for more
than two centuries. The log fort burned a year after it was built.
Buried remains of the wall, along with any weapons, ceramics and
other artifacts, were thought to have been washed away by changing
currents of the James River.
	   Anything of the first structures at the first permanent English
settlement in America seemed beyond recovery.
	   But archaeologists announced Thursday that the lost had been
found. In recent excavations, they uncovered stains of decayed wood
where they said logs of the palisade wall had stood in the ground.
	   From this they established the three-sided fort's footprint,
determining the outlines of a rounded bastion at one of the three
corners and the angle at which the walls were joined.
Archaeologists said these observations conformed exactly with
contemporary written descriptions of the original fort.
	   Archaeologists also reported finding traces of two buildings
within the fort, evidence of glass-making and copper-working
industries there and thousands of other artifacts, including
swords, armor, a smoking pipe, jewelry, ceramics and coins.
	   A grave at the site held the well-preserved skeleton of a white
man in his early 20s who probably died of a gunshot wound, a fate
raising intriguing questions about murder or mutiny or other
tempests in the early colony.
	   In making the official announcement at Jamestown Island,
Virginia Gov. George Allen declared, ``We have discovered America's
birthplace , the original fort.''
	   Dr. William Kelso, the director of archaeology of the
Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, which
owns the site and supported the excavations, said in a telephone
interview that the artifacts should afford historians a clearer
view of ``a very early Colonial society'' in the time of Queen
Elizabeth I and her successor, James I.
	   Among the most interesting finds, Kelso said, were dozens of
sky-blue glass beads apparently manufactured by the colony for
trade with the Indians. ``John Smith got himself out of hot spots
by trading these beads,'' he said.
	   The project, which is also supported by the National Geographic
Society, is expected to excavate most of the site of the one-acre
fort and surrounding town ruins by the 400th anniversary of
Jamestown, in 2007.
	   ``Any time we get early Colonial artifacts, it's important,''
said Dr. James Axtell, a historian at the College of William and
Mary in Williamsburg, Va., who specializes in the study of early
encounters between Europeans and American Indians.
	   ``There's also the symbolic significance here. Jamestown
represents the founding of Virginia and of English America, even
though other places are better examples of successful
colonization.''
	   Indeed, if John Rolfe, who married Pocahontas, had not developed
a hybrid tobacco in 1613 that won a ready market in London and the
first economic boost for the colony, historians say, Jamestown
would have become just another Colonial failure.
	   An earlier English settlement, in 1584 at Roanoke Island, which
is now part of North Carolina, was a disastrous failure. In 1562,
French Huguenots had no more luck with their Charlesfort, the site
of which on the South Carolina coast was discovered earlier this
year.
	   Three years later, in 1565, the Spanish founded St. Augustine in
what is now Florida and which is the oldest permanent European
settlement in North America outside Mexico.
