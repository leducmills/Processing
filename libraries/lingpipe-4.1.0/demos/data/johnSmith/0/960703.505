	   LOS ANGELES , Christopher Columbus trudges onto the coast of the
New World , in slow motion. To new age music.
	   A couple of newspaper reporters bring down a president , all by
themselves.
	   A heroic American Indian woman struggles for her people's
survival , and talks to raccoons.
	   It's history, Hollywood style.
	   Almost every slice of the American past has been dissected on
film, and most is available at the video store. Some is boring.
Some is wholly inaccurate. And some is even entertaining.
	   ``Some of my favorite historical movies are bad history,'' says
Mark Carnes, a Columbia University professor who edited a book
called ``Past Imperfect: History According to the Movies.''
	   ``Movies can be great works of art , and get the history
wrong.''
	   The characters and events of our past are favorite targets for
filmmakers. Their tales have been told again and again, and the
facts rarely get in the way.
	   As a character in director John Ford's ``The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance'' said: ``When the legend becomes fact, print the
legend.''
	   And so, the history of America through film doesn't resemble
your old school books. Much of it is based on imagination, gossip
and tall tales. Hollywood was always more interested in creating
its own legends.
	   But teachers, like Nancy Page Fernandez, an associate professor
at California State University, Northridge, use movies and
television programs to make the past more visual, more accessible,
more meaningful. Even if the names, dates and places don't fit
quite right, the settings and costumes can help a student learn.
	   ``There are lots of different kinds of (programs) that in one
way or another have history in them. You can learn a lot about the
1950s, for example, just by watching `I Love Lucy,' '' she says.
	   The key, Fernandez adds, is to read before you watch.
	   ``Enjoy the movies, let them draw you into the period,'' warns
Carnes, ``but don't ever believe that they're the `Truth,' with a
capital T.''
	   With that in mind, we offer a sampling of the American story on
video. Some are based on historical fact but might as well be
fictional. Some are fictional stories based on historical fact.
Either way, if you devote enough time sitting on the sofa with a
remote in one hand and a history book in the other, you might just
learn something.
The New World: You have two choices for witnessing the
discovery of America by Europeans, both films released 500 years
after Columbus came ashore: ``1492: The Conquest of Paradise''
(directed by Ridley ``Alien'' Scott) and ``Christopher Columbus:
The Discovery'' (featuring Tom Selleck).
	   ``One has as good a chance of finding historical truth by
watching the latest Columbus movies as Columbus had of finding
China,'' says Carnes. In ``The Discovery,'' nobody ages, while the
Columbus in ``1492'' sounds like Pepe le Pew.
Colonial America: Few movies have so much fun with Virginia
under British rule as ``Pocahontas,'' which was roundly panned last
year by historians. Fernandez describes it as the story of ``Indian
women who look like wood nymphs.''
	   The Pamela Anderson-esque depiction of a young American Indian
who saved Euro-hunk John Smith's life drew most of the criticism.
	   ``I have no idea what she really looked like,'' says K Caruso, a
clerk, looking up at the Disneyfied Powhatan on a giant poster
inside Tower Video in Sherman Oaks. ``She probably had bad hair.''
For more iffy history from the same period, check out the 1992
version of ``Last of the Mohicans,'' the fourth such movie to be
made from James Fenimore Cooper's novel. It was based on an earlier
screenplay, which didn't stay true to the novel, which has very
little actual history in it anyway. So the costumes may be the most
accurate part of the entire film.
The Revolution: This may be the most overlooked period of U.S.
history, according to video store shelves. Serious dramas include
the bomb ``Revolution'' (starring Mr. and Mrs. Early America, Al
Pacino and Nastassja Kinski) and the made-for-TV ``April Morning.''
Also, ``Drums Along the Mohawk,'' with Henry Fonda, takes place at
the same time but tackles different issues.
	   Carnes suggests ``1776,'' the whimsical musical about Ben
Franklin, George Washington and those other nutty Founding Fathers.
One subplot has Thomas Jefferson not being able to write the
Declaration of Independence because he's sexually frustrated.
	   ``I doubt there's too much truth to this, but it has its
moments,'' Carnes says. ``The big issue to me is to what extent
humor played a part in the writing of the Declaration.''
War of 1812: There are two versions of ``The Buccaneer'' to
choose from (1938 and 1958), both of which tell of privateer Jean
Laffite, who helped the U.S. Navy fight the British in the Battle
of New Orleans. Be warned: Any and all romantic interests are
purely imaginary.
Manifest Destiny: Remember ``The Alamo''? John Wayne as Davy
Crockett along with fellow frontiersmen Jim Bowie (Richard Widmark)
and Col. William Travis (Laurence Harvey) help save the day for
Texas independence. Historic inaccuracies abound in this film.
The Civil War: You could easily spend a few days watching
movies about this nasty war.
	   For that zooming in on old photos flavor of a PBS documentary,
try ``Lincoln'' or Ken Burns' ``Civil War'' series. If you love
made-for-TV docudramas about men living in awful conditions and
then killing each other, Turner Network Television created
``Gettysburg'' and ``Andersonville'' just for you.
	   And for the slick, yet gut-wrenching Hollywood epic, there's
``Glory,'' which tells of the first African-American infantry unit.
It also takes a look at some of today's racial issues using a
historical context.
	   Abraham Lincoln is a Hollywood favorite, even showing up in
``Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.'' The Civil War president's
cinematic image was shaped in a time unlike his own: the Great
Depression.
	   ``The moviemakers had a problem in that they wanted to make a
politician and a lawyer look good,'' Carnes says of Lincoln. ``And
this at a time when faith in politicians and lawyers was at an
all-time low.''
	   So director John Ford's ``Young Mr. Lincoln'' (1939) has the
lanky, stoic hero claiming he doesn't know much about law, only
justice. ``When, in fact,'' Carnes says, ``Lincoln was a very savvy
lawyer.''
Reconstruction: Enjoy this harsh and confusing era through the
eyes of Ida B. Wells, an African-American woman who ran a newspaper
and crusaded against post-war lynchings. Fernandez often shows her
history of American women classes the documentary ``Ida B. Wells: A
Passion for Justice,'' which might be hard to find at the video
store.
	   ``Through her life,'' Fernandez says, ``it's a wonderful way to
introduce the end of the Civil War, Reconstruction and the emerging
black middle class.''
	   For another version of the era , and one representing a
decidedly different and controversial viewpoint, that of the Ku
Klux Klan , check out ``The Birth of a Nation'' (1915), which is
best-known for making history as one of the first epic motion
pictures.
The taming of the West: Pick a western. Any western.
	   Try one of at least eight movies about legendary lawman Wyatt
Earp: ``Frontier Marshal'' (1939), ``My Darling Clementine''
(1946), ``Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' (1957), ``Hour of the Gun''
(1967), ``Doc'' (1971), ``I Married Wyatt Earp'' (1983),
``Tombstone'' (1993) or ``Wyatt Earp'' (1994).
	   Or maybe see Australian Errol Flynn as Gen. Custer in ``They
Died With Their Boots On.'' For a more overtly tall tale, which may
be just as historically accurate, try ``Little Big Man.'' And there
is ``Son of the Morning Star,'' a made-for-TV movie based on the
critically acclaimed book by Evan Connell about the battle at
Little Bighorn.
	   Or get to know the many faces of Billy the Kid. The famous
outlaw looks like Paul Newman in ``The Left-Handed Gun,'' Emilio
Estevez in ``Young Guns'' and Kris Kristofferson in ``Pat Garrett
and Billy the Kid.''
	   And don't forget John Ford's classic ``How the West Was Won.''
And if that's not enough, there's a John Wayne marathon on TNT
today, hosted by American Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton.
Turn of the century: Carnes recommends ``Hester Street'' as
the quintessential immigrants-in-New York tale. It debunks
stereotypes about tight Jewish families sticking together in the
harsh New World.
	   ``In their earliest stages in Manhattan,'' he says, ``actually,
the Jewish family would tend to be ripped apart.''
	   Elia Kazan's ``America, America,'' a tribute to his Greek
forebears, tackles the same era.
	   For more a more individualistic tale, try ``Edison: The
Man''or ``The Story of Alexander Graham Bell.''
World War I: For the American point of view, ``Sergeant York''
may have done it best. Or the 1925 silent epic, ``The Big Parade.''
While ``All Quiet on the Western Front'' may be considered a
classic, it offers the German point of view.
The '20s: Look at the decade from a few different angles with
``Eight Men Out'' (about the infamous Chicago ``Black Sox''
scandal, which actually took place in 1919), ``The Untouchables,''
Orson Welles' ``Compulsion'' or James Stewart as Charles Lindbergh
in ``The Spirit of St. Louis.''
	   And ``Knute Rockne, All American,'' a tribute to the famed Notre
Dame football coach, is important for Ronald Reagan's role as a
player (George Gipp) who dies young and inspires the phrase, ``Win
one for the Gipper!''
	   The Depression: Feel the misery with a family of fictional
pioneers looking for prosperity in California with ``The Grapes of
Wrath.'' Or through the eyes of real-life criminal legends in
``Bonnie and Clyde.'' Or through the semi-fictionalized story of
blues singer Billie Holiday in ``Lady Sings the Blues.''
World War II: Fernandez, who stresses women's history in
class, recommends the documentary ``The Life and Times of Rosie the
Riveter.''
	   Also ``The Best Years of Our Lives,'' ``Fat Man and Little
Boy,'' ``The Longest Day,'' ``A Bridge Too Far'' and ``The Glenn
Miller Story.''
	   Of course, a war this big had to leave a huge legacy in
Hollywood. If you've already seen the epics ``Tora! Tora! Tora!''
and ``Patton,'' check out John Belushi as a cigar-chomping fighter
pilot defending Los Angeles in the absurd ``1941.''
The Cold War and McCarthyism: One of the things to remember
about historical movies, says Carnes, is that they say more about
the time period in which they were made than their intended
setting.
	   ``Spartacus'' (1960), in which Kirk Douglas plays a slave
revolting against the Roman Empire, appears to take place in 73
B.C. but actually tells of the United States in the 1950s, Carnes
argues.
	   Look beneath those robes and togas and you'll see a scathing
indictment of McCarthyism and the hunt for communists in America.
Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who was blacklisted in the '50s, seeded
the film with a message, Carnes says.
	   Roman senator Crassus practically quotes U.S. Sen. Joseph
McCarthy when barking, ``Lists of the disloyal have been
compiled!''
	   Of course, this metaphor makes sense only to those familiar with
the time period. It's sort of an academic inside joke.
	   For a more direct stories of Hollywood blacklisting, try ``The
Front'' and ``Guilty by Suspicion.''
History of the justice system: ``You could easily build a
course around movies,'' says Lee Shagin, a government teacher at
Calabasas High School. ``But I can't just show one. I've got to
stop and explain and stop and explain.''
	   He screens several films in class every year and recommends any
courtroom or historical drama with Henry Fonda: ``Gideon's
Trumpet,'' Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Wrong Man'' or ``12 Angry
Men.''
Korean War: There weren't too many films made about this war,
but ``Pork Chop Hill'' and ``The Steel Helmet'' stand out among all
tales of combat. Of course, the mostly made-up ``MASH'' also takes
place during the Korean War.
Other '50s and '60s: ``The Birdman of Alcatraz'' was based on
a true story, but, of course, the key word there is ``based.''
	   Explore these years through music (``The Buddy Holly Story,''
``La Bamba,'' ``The Doors'') or the civil-rights movement (``The
Long Walk Home,'' ``Malcolm X'') or Vietnam.
Vietnam: A few tales about the war are based on specific
historical incidents, such as ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and
``Hamburger Hill.'' Most of the rest, from John Wayne's ``The Green
Berets'' to Stanley Kubrick's ``Full Metal Jacket,'' create a vivid
setting but don't chronicle much of what actually happened.
The '70s: ``For the '70s,'' says video clerk Caruso, ``I'd
recommend `Dazed and Confused.' '' But stories of stoned high
school students don't count as history in some circles. The
questionable death of nuclear plant worker Karen Silkwood
(``Silkwood'') might be a more reality-filled choice.
Recent history: Get a dumb guy's overview with ``Forrest
Gump.'' Or the paranoid perspective with Oliver Stone's ``JFK.'' Or
ponder the Watergate scandal by watching ``All the President's
Men'' or Stone's ``Nixon.''
	   However you decide to fast-forward past 500 years of
``history,'' just remember:
	   Gen. Custer did not have an Australian accent, raccoons can't
sing, Forrest Gump never met JFK, Abe Lincoln never time traveled,
John Wayne and Henry Fonda did not explore everything west of the
Mississippi all themselves and, as Carnes adds, ``Anthony Hopkins
did not, after butchering some young women, get caught by newsmen
Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman and resign as president following
Watergate.''
