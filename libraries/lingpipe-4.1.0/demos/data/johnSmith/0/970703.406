
	   JAMESTOWN, Va. , This is where America went wrong.
	   You can see the evidence all over here on the banks of the James
River, and inland a little, too, in nearby Colonial Williamsburg.
The seeds of our current national troubles , troubles we try to
ignore on the Fourth of July , all got planted here in Jamestown,
site of the first permanent English settlement in the New World.
	   Lordy, lordy. What were they thinking, Capt. John Smith and
those first folks who arrived here in 1607 , years before the
Pilgrims roasted their first Butterball turkey at Chrysler-Plymouth
Rock and, for once, smiled?
	   Consider, for instance, the current large Jamestown mystery,
which we might call ``Who Shot J.R.?''
	   Several years ago archaeologists, under the guidance of the
Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, began
excavating ground here that recently was confirmed to be the site
of the long-lost triangular 1.7-acre James Fort, which the first
settlers built to keep out marauding Spaniards (who never showed
up) and Indians and hut-to-hut salesmen and whatnot. Until a few
years ago, everyone thought the land on which that fort sat had
long since eroded into the James River.
	   The digging turned up the skeleton of a young man (about 20
years old) who died from a grievous gunshot sound to the knee and
leg. The .38-Magnum bullet or musket ball (or whatever) that killed
the guy is still stuck in his knee bones. You can see it by doing
what I did , look in the window of a small lab here where the
artifacts being unearthed are cataloged and studied.
	   Nobody knows who this dead guy was. But the wits who found his
bones have decided to call him J.R. , for James River. Thus the
mystery of who shot J.R.
	   My point is that the early English settlers brought with them
all the bad seeds we're still struggling with in this country.
	   For instance, they brought firearms. Guns kill people. A gun
killed J.R. Guns are used in crime. Crime still is with us. See how
this goes?
	   Why did the first settlers need guns? No good reason. They could
have learned to be vegetarians. Or they could have caught rabbits
and squirrels and squab in traps without all the messy bullets that
led to J.R.'s early demise and, in the end, to a trail of trouble
and blood that has stained the land.
	   The Indians, after all, didn't have guns when the USS Godspeed,
the USS Discovery and the USS Susan Constant landed here to
thunderous ambivalence on April 20, 1607, five days too late to pay
federal taxes. And neither side would have needed guns if neither
had dragged them into the equation.
	   White folks simply could have stolen the Indians' land fair and
square (the way the U.S. first got the Panama Canal) without
shooting so many of them. We'd be a prouder nation today had those
settlers simply arm-wrestled the native Americans out of their
rightful (and leftful) holdings.
	   Here's another bad idea those settlers brought with them ,
jails. Why, you show up in a new world and start building jails and
right away you're going to want to put people in them, even if
those folks have done nothing more than get behind on their credit
card payments.
	   Over in Colonial Williamsburg you can see what 17th and 18th
century jails looked like. Or, anyway, you can if you bother to
visit the place like I did.
	   Those jails are awful. They're just wooden rooms full of nothing
but a bit of straw and a funny-looking place in the corner to go to
the bathroom. You drag people into a place like that and pretty
soon they don't seem like people so much as like animals or
low-down talk show hosts or something.
	   You let a thing like that go on a few hundred years and you wind
up putting people in prison at a higher rate than any country but
Russia. That's the situation today, and it's costing us a fortune.
	   How did we let this happen? Why, we got led astray by the bad
ideas imported by the Brits who showed up here in Virginia nearly
400 years ago.
	   We'd have been better off today had the English stayed home and
let the French colonize Virginia. Oh, they'd have brought along
most of the same bad ideas, but at least they cook better and know
a little about good wine.
