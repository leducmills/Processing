CITY STREETS

	   From Anita Garlick:
	   Overheard in the lobby of a movie theater showing
``Pocahontas'':
Grandmother to 5-year-old grandson: ``I'm so disappointed. I
thought John Smith marries Pocahontas.''
Little boy, earnestly: ``Oh, no, they can't get married:
they're different. He's bullets , she's arrows.''


YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS STUFF UP

	   BUCHAREST, Romania , It sounded like an April Fool's Day story-
 two lovers killed by a train while locked in a passionate embrace
on the tracks. But only partly ...
	   Reports of ``two young lovers'' slain in such an incident swept
news media here, prompting an embarrassed statement from police in
western Romania.
	   ``It's true that they were lovers...but they were pigs,'' Sgt.
Daniel Ranca of the railroad police said from Arad, on the western
border with Hungary. ``They were caught mating on the rail track
and were killed on the spot by a train,'' he said. 
	   ``A sow and a male pig, more precisely,'' he added, in a
reference to the couple newspapers had identified only as Tita and
Belu. ``By now their owner must have made good use of them.''


GEORGE CARLIN, AS HEARD ON ``HBO COMEDY HOUR: GEORGE CARLIN --
BACK IN TOWN.''

	   Following are quotes from the special:
	   On the conservative right and abortion: ``They're all in favor
of the unborn ... but once you're born, you're on your own.
Pro-live conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception
'til nine months. After that, they don't want to hear from you. No
neo-natal care, no day care, no Head Start, no school lunch, no
food stamps, no welfare, no nothing.

	   On the death penalty: ``A lot of people in this country now want
to expand the death penalty to include drug dealers. This is really
stupid. Drug dealers aren't afraid to die. They're already killing
themselves each other, every day, on the streets, by the hundreds ,
drive-bys, gang shootings. They're not afraid to die. The death
penalty doesn't mean anything unless you use it on people who are
afraid to die , like the bankers who launder the drug money. Forget
the dealers. You want to slow down that drug traffic, you got to
start executing a few of those ... bankers... white, middle-class,
Republican bankers.''

	   On common phrases:
	   Undisputed heavyweight champion: ``Well, if it's undisputed,
what's all the fighting about?''
	   Takes the cake: ``Where? Where do you take a cake? To the
movies?? You know where I would take a cake? Down to the bakery to
see the other cakes. And how come he takes the cake? How come he
don't take the pie? Pie is easier to carry than cake , easy as pie.
Cake is not too hard to carry either , piece of cake.''
	   In your own words: ``Tell us in your own words. Do you have your
own words? Hey, I'm using the ones everyone else is using.''

	   Carlin aimed his ``random anger'' at 24 different ``minor,
cultural items'' that annoy him, including hyphenated names, bad
hair days and people whose ``needs aren't being met'':

	   ``And what's happening in this country that suddenly now
everyone is walking around with their own personal bottle of water?
Where do we get so thirsty in America? Is everyone so... dehydrated
they have to have their own portable supply of fluids with them at
all time? Get a drink before you leave the house!

	   ``Can anyone explain to me the need for one-hour
photo-finishing? You just saw the thing! How can you possibly get
nostalgic about a concept like 'a little while ago.'

	   ``A tip for the guys , this whole thing with earrings? It's
over. It's been over for a long time fellas. It doesn't mean
anything anymore. It was supposed to pi.. off the squares, but the
squares are wearing them now.''


DAVID-LETTERMAN LATE SHOW TOP TEN
``Signs Dick Vitale is Nuts''

	   10. I like to run through a locker room wearing nothing but a
referee's whistle and yelling ``Baby!''
	   9. I keep repainting the roof of my house to match Dennis
Rodman's hair.
	   8. Five seconds after my first child was born, I dumped Gatorade
on my wife.
	   7. I'm on a strict diet of shoelaces and floor wax.
	   6. I've invited Dave Letterman to host next year's ESPY Awards.
	   5. For a cheap rush, I take hits of stale air from old
basketballs.
	   4. My pet project: ESPN 3, a new channel devoted to the coverage
of my Rogaine treatment.
	   3. When I make love to my wife, I always go for the three
pointer, baby.
	   2. I've referred to everything as baby, except an actual baby.
	   1. Right now, I think I'm whispering!


BILL'S WORLD
By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star

	   On the first day of his new trial, Jack Kevorkian showed up in a
colonial costume. Doesn't this guy just kill you?

	   Colin Powell called Bob Dole the other day to congratulate him
on winning. Did he use his regular phone or his veeper?

	   Two of the Baby Bells are merging. We suppose the larger size
will make it necessary to call the new company a Toddler Bell.

	   Boris Yeltsin is trying to end the long war in Chechnya. Why not
put Mikhail Gorbachev in charge? He once ended a whole country.

	   ``We're all moving into an age of information and technology and
global trade,'' Mr. Clinton says. And best of all, baseball box
scores again.

	   The first official game of the 1996 major league baseball season
went extra innings. Hope this isn't the players' way of slowly
giving fans back all the canceled games of the last two seasons.

	   It's cherry blossom festival time in Washington, D.C. But the
blossoms, like nearly everything there, eventually will put the
place deeper into the red.

	   A new report lists billions of dollars of wasteful Pentagon
spending in recent years. In a time of great change, it's good to
know some things can be depended upon.

	   Who decides this stuff, anyway? Why does the Easter Bunny have
to make his extensive rounds the same night we turn the clock ahead
and lose an hour?

	   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein finally saw the movie ``Pulp Fiction''
and was surprised to find it had nothing to do with false claims on
containers that the orange juice inside is fresh-squeezed.
