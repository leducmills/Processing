	   Nearly four centuries after the explorer called this wooded,
rocky coastline ``New England,'' an overwhelming majority of the 13
million people here still consider the region more than mere words
on a map.
	   By margins that startled survey analysts, New Englanders say the
six-state region is a special, positive place distinctly different
from the rest of the nation. And because of the high regard New
Englanders also have for their hometowns, most of them don't want
to move.
	   But the survey by the Roper Center for Public Policy Research
also indicated that New England may be developing its own
Mason-Dixon line, a statistically stark border between three
northern states brimming with contentment, and three southern ones
fretting about the future.
	   ``We found an obvious, blatant north-south split that we didn't
anticipate,'' said Chris Barnes, senior research analyst for the
survey. ``Maybe there is some intrinsic sense of New England, some
community pride, that just happens to be stronger up there.''
	   Nearly 90 percent of the people surveyed from Maine, New
Hampshire and Vermont describe their states as ``good'' or
``excellent,'' with nearly half of Vermont's respondents calling
the Green Mountain State an ``excellent'' place to live.
	   For George Pettinico, a veteran pollster who oversaw the survey,
those positive ratings are nearly off the charts. ``In the kind of
cynical society we have today, `excellent' is a very strong word to
use,'' he said.
	   The numbers drop off south of Nashua and Brattleboro, but the
positive figures for individual states remain impressive when
considered alone: 73 percent in Massachusetts; 59 percent in
Connecticut; 43 percent in Rhode Island.
	   Although their satisfaction levels differ, New Englanders agree
on the weather. It's what New Englanders , north and south , like
most about the region. It's also what they most dislike.
The survey, the first in the nation to measure regional
identity, ``gives us a sense that New England is important to its
residents,'' Barnes said. ``Not only is it unique, but people care.
People seem to value the character of New England.''
	   The wide-ranging survey of 1,200 people, conducted Feb. 16 to
Feb. 29 with a 2.9 percent margin of error, also found:
76 percent of the respondents consider New England a unique
part of the country.
Flattering stereotypes are thriving. Fifty-four percent say New
Englanders are more thrifty than most Americans; 53 percent believe
the region has harder workers.
Negative stereotypes have been rejected. Sixty-one percent say
residents are not less friendly than most Americans; 64 percent say
New Englanders are not less religious.
78 percent call their communities ``excellent'' or ``good.''
59 percent of New Englanders, and 71 percent in the northern
three states, do not want to move.
47 percent would choose a small town or suburb if they could
live anywhere; 45 percent would choose the countryside.
68 percent of New Englanders, and 80 percent of northerners,
feel a strong sense of community.
	   Still, many people from Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode
Island diverge from the north when they ponder the future.
	   For them, analysts say, the boom and bust in Massachusetts, the
banking crisis in Rhode Island, and defense and insurance cutbacks
in Connecticut have eroded confidence and self-esteem. Negative
ratings for the economic future in those states far outstripped the
pessimistic responses in the north.
	   In Rhode Island, only 25 percent say better days are ahead. In
Massachusetts, 30 percent think the economy will improve. In Maine,
the figure is 41 percent.


Striking disparities


	   Such differences between north and south appeared on question
after question in the survey, but Rhode Island produced the most
striking disparities.
	   Although 37 percent of Mainers call their state ``excellent,''
only 10 percent of Rhode Islanders feel the same about their state.
And while just 1 percent of New Hampshire residents rate their
state a ``poor'' choice, fully 19 percent of Rhode Islanders do.
	   ``Rhode Islanders were at the bottom of the barrel in nearly
every category,'' Pettinico said.
	   Barnes, the Roper Center research analyst, said he is unsure
whether economic issues, crime and population density help explain
the north-south difference. For example, residents of some sparsely
settled Massachusetts counties are less satisfied than
more-populated areas in Maine, he said.
	   Barnes, however, acknowledged that the results, when compared
state to state, do suggest a correlation between positive ratings
and population density.
Such a connection seems obvious to Barbara Ziegler of
Morrisville, Vt. Indeed, that's the reason she moved from
metropolitan New York after living there for 60 years.
	   ``It's slower here, more relaxed, and people will go out of
their way to help you out,'' she said. ``You might find a few who
are a little taciturn, but, hey, you just go along with it.''
	   Ziegler and her husband retired four years ago to a new house on
a 10-acre plot ``where nobody can build next to us.'' Now, she
spends her days gardening and painting, and her husband has taken
up rug-hooking and woodworking.
	   ``Everybody was in a hurry in Yorktown Heights,'' Ziegler said
of her former home. ``It just became one awful place. I couldn't
wait to get out of there, to tell you the truth.''
	   Another person who would move tomorrow if she could , but out of
New England , is Cheryl Beauregard of Berlin, Mass. Beauregard has
two sons in Florida, and the many automobile trips she and her
husband take to visit them have been a revelation.
	   ``It was like, wow, there's another part of the country out
there,'' she said. ``We used to be rural and old farms up here, but
we're not that anymore. Every time you turn around, another
building is going up. It's supposed to help, but I don't see taxes
going down.''
	   Rising taxes, deteriorating cities, congestion, a lack of good
jobs , all these complaints are much more prevalent from southern
New Englanders. They are also among the reasons why most northern
respondents choose Rhode Island, Connecticut or Massachusetts as
the ``worst'' New England state.
	   But satisfaction does not equal quality of life, said Boston
College professor Thomas O'Connor, who prefers the vibrancy of the
city to the rural life.
	   ``I like concrete. I like to go in the subway, come up in Park
Street and smell the gasoline,'' said O'Connor, who teaches
American history. ``I feel it's a good thing if people are not
satisfied. If you're satisfied, you don't want to change anything,
and you're happy living the same way now as your father and your
grandfather did.
	   ``As an urbanite,'' O'Connor added, ``I would say it's
dissatisfaction that promotes change, and change in many ways
promotes progress.''


Special climate


	   But despite greater frustration in the south, and despite
conducting the survey during the worst winter on record, most
respondents said they would not consider moving to a more
hospitable climate.
	   ``We have something special, and we're bright enough to know
it,'' said Peter Meade, president of the New England Council.
``It's a beautiful place to live because of the four seasons,
notwithstanding the last winter.''
	   Meade also cited the area's varied geography, cultural offerings
and rich history, all of which rank high in the survey as traits
that make the region unique.
	   For the Roper Center, based at the University of Connecticut,
this baseline survey is the first study of what the researchers
plan to make an annual project. A Connecticut company, which asked
to remain anonymous, provided the funding for a study that Roper
Center researchers say they long have wanted to do.
	   In the future, Barnes says, the pollsters want to get closer to
the differences between north and south.
	   ``Is there really a distinct lifestyle in New England, and is
there a strict lifestyle that differentiates northern New England
from southern New England?'' he said. ``Some of this stuff is hard
to define, but you can feel it traveling through New England. You
can feel it's true.''
	   But until more surveys are completed, before New Englanders are
asked in greater detail about their own states, the initial results
indicate that New England is well , if vulnerable at the seam.
