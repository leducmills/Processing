(Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
	   By now you've taken the kids to see ``The Hunchback of Notre
Dame.'' Maybe even twice.
	   This leaves you with the problem of quenching the ensuing Disney
Fever until next summer's probable blockbuster, ``Hercules,'' comes
along.
	   Luckily, most of Disney's animated features are available on
home video. This guide is designed to provide children (and parents
 you'll be watching too) with handy information about the best of
Disney's releases. Here's the scoring:
	   Entertainment: 10 is outstanding, 1 is dull.
	   Fright: 10 is all sweetness and light, 1 is nightmare
	   inducing.
	   Amusement: 10 is completely engaging, 1 is your child falling
	   asleep.
	   Adult Interest: 10 is love it, 1 is ignore it.

``Snow White'' (1937): For years Disney said it would never
release this film for home viewing, but the studio finally did in
1994, and millions of Disney fans worldwide rejoiced.
	   The adventures of the princess who stumbles upon a band of
dwarfs while her evil stepmother is plotting to kill her is
absolutely the most beautifully animated film of all time.
	   The plot is serviceable and well known, and the songs are
lovely, but this is a film you can love even with the sound off.
	   Entertainment: What's not to love? 10.
	   Fright: The dark forest is sort of scary, as is the witch, but
viewing this in the comfort of one's living room is a far cry from
seeing it 20 feet tall in a darkened movie theater. 8.
	   Amusement: Mushy parts. 9.
	   Adult Interest: Even a classic can be a little too sweet at
points. 8.
-0-
``Pinocchio (1940): This is the second most beautifully
animated film of all time.
	   The tale of a puppet who wants to be a real boy has more of a
real plot than ``Snow White.'' It also has characters that kids can
more easily relate to and moral lessons in every scene, from the
dangers of lying and smoking to the hazards of hedonism.
	   Entertainment: If Walt Disney thought of Snow White as his
daughter, Pinocchio was his son. The craftsmanship and artistry are
outstanding. 10.
	   Fright: Pinocchio gets locked in a cage and turned into a
donkey. But he's only a puppet. 9.
	   Amusement: It's fast-paced and very lively. 10.
	   Adult Interest: Adults already know they're not supposed to lie
or smoke. 8.
-0-
``Fantasia'' (1940). Eight pieces of classical music are given
visual accompaniment in as many different styles. Think of them as
music videos for Bach and Schubert.
	   ``The Dance of the Hours,'' with waltzing hippos and alligators,
is sure to please, as is ``The Rite of Spring,'' if only because it
features dinosaurs.
	   Includes the classic Mickey as ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.''
	   Entertainment: If one musical segment doesn't interest you, the
next almost certainly will. 7.
	   Fright: Just the demons and ghosts in ``Night on Bald
Mountain.'' 8.
	   Amusement: Depends on your child's interest in music or
attention span. 8.
	   Adult interest: Depends on your interest in music or attention
span. 7.
-0-
``Dumbo'' (1941): Dumbo is the little elephant ostracized
because of his big ears but praised once it is discovered that
those ears allow him to fly.
	   The importance of friendship, family and standing by those you
care about is well presented.
	   Entertainment: The film conveys a sense of genuine compassion
that's rare in animation. 7.
	   Fright: Some of the circus scenes are a little intense, if not
scary. 9.
	   Amusement: Not everyone is interested in circuses. 8.
	   Adult Interest: Dumbo never speaks, so most of the plot is
visual. 8.
-0-
``Bambi'' (1942): This film about a young fawn and his friends
has become the symbol for all that is quintessentially Disney.
Unfortunately, it is also just a little too cute.
	   Entertainment: ``Realistic'' animation captures the feeling of
the forest and its inhabitants wonderfully. 8.
	   Fright: The fire scene and the death of Bambi's mother have been
childhood rites of passage for generations. 8.
	   Amusement: Older children can only take so many cute animals,
but at 70 minutes, it's a short film. 8.
	   Adult Interest: See ``Amusement'' above. 8.
-0-
``Cinderella'' (1950): The overworked girl, the fairy
godmother and the glass slipper get immortalized by Disney.
	   Entertainment: Well-matched voices and graceful, lovely music
really help. 7.
	   Fright: An evil stepmother but not nearly as sinister as Snow
White's witch. 10.
	   Amusement: The subplots only barely distract from the main
story. 10.
	   Adult Interest: It's the fairy tale brought to life. 7.
-0-
``Alice In Wonderland'' (1951): This is much more interesting
for anyone who isn't familiar with the Lewis Carroll classic about
a young girl in a very strange world.
	   The songs are forgettable, and the action and colors are
inappropriately bright and splashy.
	   Entertainment: This is only nominally the Alice and Wonderland
of the books, and an instance in which Disney proves how hard it is
to improve upon an original. 5.
	   Fright: ``Off with their heads!'' 9.
	   Amusement: Lewis Carroll's nonsense plus Walt Disney's nonsense
can equal some confusion. 8.
	   Adult Interest: Likable but nothing you'd want to see more than
once. 8.
-0-
``Peter Pan'' (1953): The boy who never grew up takes his
friends to Never Never Land. Lots of jolly songs, especially
``Never Smile at a Crocodile.''
	   Entertainment: Beautiful scenery and dramatic action make for a
good combination. 7.
	   Fright: The man-eating crocodile is nothing to fear. 10.
	   Amusement: Pirates, flying, sword-fights, pixies, Indians , it's
mesmerizing. 10.
	   Adult Interest: It's the one Disney adventure that most of us
would like to live out. 7.
-0-
``Lady and the Tramp'' (1955): Charming and sweet as two dogs,
one well-bred, the other a mongrel, meet and fall in love.
	   Entertainment: The world of the domestic pet has never been
better explored. 8.
	   Fright: Life on the streets isn't that bad. 10.
	   Amusement: Some of the '50s songs hold up better than others. 8.
	   Adult Interest: The dogs' ``date'' is wildly comic, yet in the
end cute. 7.
-0-
``Sleeping Beauty'' (1959): Put under a spell, the young
princess can only be awakened by a prince's kiss , if he can get to
her.
	   Entertainment: This is a film that looks interesting, but not a
whole lot actually happens. 5.
	   Fright: The final battle between Prince Phillip and the dragon
is quite powerful. 8.
	   Amusement: The original fairy tale is rather short. Disney had
to pad the story a lot to make a feature-length film, resulting in
an action cartoon that moves slowly. 7.
	   Adult Interest: Music from Tchaikovsky's ballet ``Sleeping
Beauty'' is used throughout, punching things up a little. 6.
-0-
``101 Dalmatians'' (1961): When a litter of young Dalmatians
is kidnapped (puppynapped?), it's up to a band of local dogs to
free them.
	   Entertainment: All those dogs! All those spots! It's amazing to
watch. 7.
	   Fright: Arch villainess Cruella DeVil plans to make coats from
the puppies! Fortunately she fails. 9.
	   Amusement: Depending on how the viewer feels about the music of
the early 1960s, the songs are either wacky and catchy or just
plain dull. 10.
	   Adult Interest: If you're a ``dog person,'' 6. Otherwise, 5.
-0-
``The Jungle Book'' (1967): Rudyard Kipling's story of a boy
raised by animals in India gets the Disney treatment.
	   A couple of 1960s elements date it, but the voice talents of
Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera the tiger and Phil Harris as Baloo the
bear save the day.
	   Entertainment: The last animated feature produced by Walt Disney
himself, it still has some of his charm.
	   Fright: Only if the viewer is bothered by snakes who are
decidedly cute and silly. 10.
	   Amusement: For a jungle adventure, it can drag a little. 9.
	   Adult Interest: The 1960s hairdos and music haven't aged well.
7.
-0-
``The Aristocats'' (1970): Duchess the cat and her kittens
stand to inherit a fortune but have to fight to get it away from
the conniving butler.
	   Entertainment: The voices are the real stars, with Phil Harris
as O'Malley the Alley Cat and Eva Gabor as Duchess. 7.
	   Fright: Just some rollicking chase scenes. 10.
	   Amusement: Better for younger kids who aren't too demanding. 9.
	   Adult Interest: You don't have to love cats to find this
engaging. 7.
-0-
``Robin Hood'' (1973): Disney gives a clever twist to the
Robin Hood legends by casting animals in all the roles, from a
crafty fox as Robin to a scraggly lion as the evil Prince John.
	   Entertainment: The spirit of adventure is well-preserved here.
7.
	   Fright: Just another cute snake a la ``The Jungle Book.'' 10.
	   Amusement: Lots of daring deeds and thrilling escapes. 10.
	   Adult Interest: It's not as good as Errol Flynn's Robin Hood,
but it's not as bad as Kevin Costner's. 6.
-0-
``The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' (1977): Here,
Disney collects all the half-hour Pooh shorts that were first shown
in theaters and later aired on television.
	   These are so good, and so winningly narrated by Sebastian Cabot,
that you can't not be delighted.
	   Entertainment: By faithfully adapting A.A. Milne's stories,
Disney avoided the sort of mistakes it made with ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' 8.
	   Fright: The surrealistic ``Hephalumps and Woozies'' scene is
enough to spook anyone. 9.
	   Amusement: Everyone likes Winnie the Pooh, especially the
younger kids. 10.
	   Adult Interest: If you grew up watching these on television,
you'll enjoy the nostalgia. 7.
-0-
``The Rescuers'' (1977): A little girl is pressed into
locating a gem, and two mice (voices of Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart)
are sent to help her escape.
	   Entertainment: It's slow getting started and slow coming to an
end. 5.
	   Fright: Dark and misty bogs and a really mean , and scarier
because she's human , villain. 8.
	   Amusement: There's nothing particularly new or exciting here. 8.
	   Adult Interest: Not much to see, nothing to listen to and
neither the villain nor the heroes hold your attention. 4.
-0-
``The Great Mouse Detective'' (1986): Sherlock Holmes is
transposed into the world of mice in the form of Basil of Baker
Street and his archenemy, the evil Ratigan (voice by Vincent
Price).
	   Entertainment: Sheer delight. 7.
	   Fright: Dramatic and wonderfully animated chase scenes are
almost too real for smaller children. 9.
	   Amusement: Some of the plot exposition drags a bit. 9.
	   Adult Interest: This isn't the ``authentic'' Holmes, but it's
fun. 6. (Or 7 if you're a Sherlock Holmes fan.)
-0-
``The Little Mermaid'' (1989): This is the film that brought
Disney animation back from the brink of death and started a new
Golden Age.
	   Ariel, the mermaid princess, trades her voice to the evil sea
witch for a pair of legs so that she can walk on the land and
pursue Erik, a handsome prince.
	   Entertainment: Every song is a winner, the animation is smooth
and lovely, and the story moves along at a brisk pace. 10.
	   Fright: Some dark, moody doings under the murky sea, but they're
still charming. 10.
	   Amusement: There's always something fascinating happening, even
during the slower songs. 10.
	   Adult Interest: It takes all of the Disney cliches and makes
them fresh and vibrant again. 10.
-0-
``Beauty and the Beast'' (1991): Will the young beauty fall in
love with the ugly beast and break his curse before it's too late?
	   This was the first fully animated film to be nominated for an
Academy Award for best picture, and justifiably so.
	   Entertainment: Academy Award-winning songs, Broadway-quality
production numbers and a credible love story make it a classic. 10.
	   Fright: The Beast may be shocking at first, but you grow to love
him. 9.
	   Amusement: Perfectly balanced sentiment, laughs and excitement.
10.
	   Adult Interest: This film is different , a different sort of
heroine, a different sort of villain and even a different sort of
animation as computers were used by Disney on a large scale for the
first time. 10.
-0-
``Aladdin'' (1992): The Disney version of a lad, a lamp and a
genie is a little too fast-paced for smaller children, who also
might not get most of the cultural references.
	   But they're sure to enjoy watching the Genie change shape and
hearing Robin Williams do dozens of funny voices.
	   Entertainment: Catchy songs, strong, tight plot and lots of
laughs. 10.
	   Fright: A lot of swordplay and some rather evil-looking
villains. 9.
	   Amusement: So much is going on that it's hard to take your eyes
off the screen. 10.
	   Adult Interest: Williams' work and plenty of background details
 look for the Beast among the Sultan's toys , make this thoroughly
enjoyable. 9.
-0-
``The Lion King'' (1994): Disney sets Shakespeare's Hamlet in
the African veldt. Simba the lion must restore lion dominance over
his domain and take his murdered father's place as king.
	   Entertainment: Good sidekicks, clever production numbers and
lush, naturalistic animation make it a winner. 8.
	   Fright: Simba witnesses the death of his father and then
believes that he is responsible. Not really scary but perhaps
angst-inducing. 8.
	   Amusement: There's a tacked-on love story, but ``Lady and the
Tramp'' did animal romance better. 8.
	   Adult Interest: This is Disney's first film whose moral is:
``Grow up! Get out there and be responsible!'' There's a lesson in
that for everyone. 9.
-0-
``A Goofy Movie'' (1995): The story of Goofy and his teen-age
son, Max, follows their travels through a series of adventures in
which Goofy tries to pass on his own brand of wisdom while Max just
doesn't want his dad cramping his style.
	   Unexpectedly clever and well-done.
	   Entertainment: Goofy gets a great full-length treatment. The
rock songs don't weigh it down, but they don't pick it up either.
9.
	   Fright: The only ``monster'' is played for laughs. 10.
	   Amusement: Some of the subtler problems of being a teen-ager
might not appeal to 4-year-olds. 8.
	   Adult Interest: Goofy will remind you of either yourself or your
parents. 8.
-0-
``Pocahontas'' (1995): Disney's first attempt to animate a
story that actually happened suffers from not having enough to say.
	   Englishman John Smith meets American Indian Pocahontas, and the
two become star-crossed lovers.
	   The message is pro-environment and pro-tolerance, but after that
it's only so much filler. Filler that's beautiful to look at, but
still filler.
	   Entertainment: Nice, stylized visuals, but it's not a good sign
when the sidekicks are more interesting than the main characters.
7.
	   Fright: A little blood shed and lots of guns but still
Disney-level tame. 9.
	   Amusement: For all its flaws, it's quite engrossing. 10.
	   Adult Interest: With so little story, the songs are the main
attraction. 6.
