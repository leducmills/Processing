	   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The Arizona State wrestling coach is not
surprised that Shawn Ford fails to mention his connection with
Oklahoma State's Eric Guerrero.
	   That they essentially grew up together: Ford in Santa Clara,
Calif., and Guerrero in San Jose. That their high schools are
rivals. Ford ``didn't look much past Tracy (Brown)'' in those days,
Lee Roy Smith said.
	   ``He didn't have that kind of scope.''
	   Brown was the wrestling pinnacle at Santa Clara High School,
where he was 51-1 and won a state championship as a senior.
Guerrero was even bigger at San Jose Independence High. Smith
wanted both at ASU. He landed Brown, now at 142 pounds, in his
first recruiting class, but two years later lost Guerrero to
Oklahoma State, where Smith's brother, John, is the coach.
	   In between was Ford.
	   ``We didn't know him'' to even recruit him as a walk-on, Smith
said. But since it was Brown's father, Ford said, who demanded he
wrestle in high school, he decided to follow Brown to ASU instead
of pursuing applications to Illinois State, North Carolina State or
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo.
	   ``I knew I could walk on, but I wasn't even sure if I'd
wrestle,'' said Ford, who initially took a job in anticipation of
working his way through college while studying to be a
chiropractor.
	   ``I probably didn't know his name for the first two months of
practice,'' admits Smith, until an injury left him with no one to
wrestle at 126 pounds going into the Las Vegas Invitational in
December 1994.
	   Ford, being the only healthy candidate at that weight, got the
job.
	   He has yet to relinquish it.
	   Now 26-6 and ranked sixth in the country, Ford leads 10th-ranked
ASU (13-4) into its dual-meet finale at 3 p.m. Sunday against No. 1
Oklahoma State (18-0) at the Activity Center. That means a meeting
with Guerrero (22-1), who is ranked first nationally and as a
freshman last year was the national Rookie of the Year.
	   The two missed each other Jan. 2 at the Reno (Nev.) Duals
because Ford was injured. John Smith's team embarrassed his older
brother's that day, 42-0, but only No. 2 Iowa (21-13) and No. 9
Iowa State (18-15) have been truly competitive with the Cowboys.
	   Lee Roy Smith thinks the Sun Devils can be much closer this
time, particularly if Ford finds a way to topple Guerrero and
diminish Oklahoma State's lower-weight domination.
	   To even think a former walk-on could handle such a role speaks
to Ford's work ethic and the coaching of Smith and his staff,
particularly 1992 Olympic silver medalist Zeke Jones, who is
approximately Ford's size.
	   ``He (Jones) is at the level I'm trying to get to,'' Ford said.
``I took my bruises at first, but after a while, I started to get
the hang of it. I've learned from everyone.''
	   Because Ford's prep success was greatest in the Greco-Roman
style, he came to ASU as a blank slate, willing to learn, Smith
said. ``He's like soft clay,'' willing to be molded into a style
that accentuates his quickness and balance. ``He has matured his
upper body so he's not getting pushed around.''
	   Guerrero can push most anyone. He was 35-6 as a freshman and
fifth at the NCAA Championships. ``He's a buzz saw from start to
finish,'' Smith said.
	   But, he continued, ``I'm confident Shawn is ready to contend
with anybody in that weight class.''
	   Ford proved that to himself at the 1996 nationals with an
improbable second-round victory over defending champion Jeff
McGinness of Iowa. He has handled the Iowa challenge again this
year, with two victories over second-ranked Mike Mena.
	   After beating McGinness, ``I was completely confident I could
hang with the best of them,'' Ford said. ``I knew then it was a
matter of time if I stayed with it.''
	   Ford's losses are all to ranked opponents, including two to No.
5 Coby Wright of defending Pac-10 champion Cal State-Bakersfield.
The conference championships are at ASU, March 2-3.
