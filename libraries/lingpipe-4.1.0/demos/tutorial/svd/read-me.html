<h2>What is Singular Value Decomposition?</h2>

<h3>SVD as Factorization</h3>

<p>Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a means of decomposing a a
matrix into a product of three simpler matrices.  In this way it is
related to other matrix decompositions such as eigen decomposition,
principal components analysis (PCA), and non-negative matrix
factorization (NNMF).</p>

<h3>SVD as Least Squares Approximation</h3>

<p>Full rank SVD recreates the underlying matrix exactly, whereas
lower-order SVD provides the best (in the least square error sense)
approximation of a matrix by orthogonal row and column factors.
These lower-order approximations to the larger
matrix may uncover interesting relationships among the rows and/or
columns of the underlying matrix.</p>

<h3>SVD for Matrices with Unknown Values</h3>

<p>LingPipe's stocastic gradient descent SVD solver is designed to
accomodate a partial matrix as input.  By partial, we mean a matrix
only some of whose values are known.  SVD may be used in this case to
impute the value of the positions whose values are unknown.  In so
doing, it uses the least-squares property of singular value
decomposition.</p>



<h2>Applications of SVD</h2>

<p>Singular value decomposition may be applied anywhere a least-squares
fit, possibly with unknown values, is needed.</p>

<h3>Latent Semantic Analysis</h3>

<p> The original and most well known application of SVD in natural language processing has
been for latent semantic analysis (LSA).
LSA is an application of reduced-order SVD in
which the rows of the input matrix represent words and the columns
documents, with entries being the count of the words in the document.
The singular vectors and correspdoning singular values produced by SVD
allow words and documents to be mapped into the same &quot;latent
semantic space&quot;.  The resulting embedding places similar words
and documents as measured by co-occurrence near one another even if
they never co-occurred in the training corpus.
</p>

<h3>Latent Semantic Indexing</h3>

<p>It is straightforward to apply LSA's notion of term-document
similarity to information retrieval, the resulting systems being
known as latent semantic indexing (LSI).  A query consisting of
several terms just corresponds to the sum of their k-dimensional vector
representations.  The resulting k-dimensional query vector may be
compared to the k-dimensional document vectors to determine similarity
(typically using the cosine measure).</p>

<h3>SVD for General Classification</h3>

<p>Latent semantic indexing is really just a simple classification
problem where each document is its own category, the training
data for the category is the text extracted from the document,
and where queries are just texts to classify. </p>

<p>Many researchers have applied SVD to other classification problems.
The hope, in these cases, is for a degree of robustness arising from
the lower-order representation of terms and documents.  For instance,
the main architect of LingPipe, Bob Carpenter, applied it with
Jennifer Chu-Carroll to automatic routing of telphone calls (after a
speech recognition phase), and more interestingly, to generating
follow-up questions to resolve ambiguities for marginal queries.
Follow-up questions were generated by looking for terms that could
be added to the query to resolve it as one category or another.
</p>

<h3>SVD for Clustering and Features</h3>
<p>
Because of the simple vector representations of terms and documents
produced by SVD, SVD (as well as PCA) has been widely used for
clustering.
</p>
<p>
More generally, SVD has been applied to feature generation.
Rather than taking raw features, or in addition to raw features,
it is common to add the first few factors from the singular
value decomposition of relevant inputs (such as words).  These
decompositions may be drawn from large data sets in the hopes
of smoothing the representations with reasonable assumptions about
their meanings.
</p>



<h3>SVD for Collaborative Filtering</h3>

<p>Outside of strictly linguistic applications, SVD has been used for
collaborative filtering, most notably in the context of the
<a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix Prize</a>
competition.  In this context, rows represent users and columns
represent movies.  The scores that exist are ratings provided by
users for films (on a 1-5 integer scale).  The contest involves
guessing ratings for films a user hasn't rated; that is, imputing
the unknown values.
</p>


<h2>Definition of SVD</h2>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Repeating Ourselves</h2>
<p>
A similar technical description of SVD may be found in
the class documentation for:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../docs/api/com/aliasi/matrix/SvdMatrix.html"><code>com.aliasi.matrix.SvdMatrix</code></a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
We first consider the case where all values are known.  When all values
are known,
singular value decomposition (SVD) factors an
<code>m&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;n</code> matrix <code>A</code> into a product of
three matrices:</p>

<pre class="code">
A = U * S * V<sup><sup>T</sup></sup>
</pre>

<p>where <code>U</code> is an <code>m&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;k</code> matrix,
<code>V</code> is an <code>n&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;k</code> matrix, and
<code>S</code> is a <code>k&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;k</code> matrix, where
<code>k</code> is the rank of the matrix <code>A</code>.  The
multiplication (<code>*</code>) is matrix multiplication and
the superscripted <code>T</code> indicates matrix transposition.</p>

<h3>Singular Vectors: An Orthonormal Basis</h3>

<p>The <code>m</code>-dimensional vectors making up the columns of
<code>U</code> are called left singular vectors, whereas
the <code>n</code>-dimesnional vectors making up the columns of
<code>V</code> are called right singular vectors.</p>

<p> The set of left and set of right singular vectors are orthonormal
(that is, both orthogonal and normal).  Normality means that each
singular vector is of unit length (length <code>1</code>).  A set of
vectors is said to be orthogonal if any pair of vectors in the set is
orthogonal; recall that vectors are orthogonal if and only if their
product (equivalently cosine) is zero (<code>0</code>).  Orthogonality
that any pair of left singular vectors is The right singular vectors
are also orthonormal, being of unit length and pairwise orthogonal.  </p>

<h3>Singular Values: Factor Weighting</h3>

<p> The values on the diagonal of <code>S</code> are called the
singular values.  The combination of
the <code>q</code>-th left singular vector, right singular vector and
singular value is known as a factor.  The singular values determine
the relative importance of the dimensions, and are arranged in
non-increasing order:
</p>
<pre class="code">
S[i][i] &gt;= S[i+1][i+1]   &nbsp;&nbsp; (for i &lt; k)
</pre>

<h3>Uniqueness</h3>

<p>Matrices have unique singular-value decompositions
up to the re-ordering of columns with equal singular values and
up to offsetting sign changes in the singular vectors.</p>

<h3>Implementing SVD Matrices</h3>

<p>The upshot of the first equation <code>A = U * S * V<sup><sup>T</sup></sup></code>
is that a single value <code>A[i][j]</code> in the matrix may be computed by the
dot product of the <code>i</code>-th row vector and the <code>j</code>-th column
vector, scaled by singular values:
</p>

<pre class="code">
A[i][j]

= <big><big>&Sigma;</big></big><sub>i &lt; k</sub> U[i][k] * S[k][k] * V[j][k]

= <big><big>&Sigma;</big></big><sub>i &lt; k</sub>  U[i][k] * sqrt(S[k][k]) * sqrt(S[k][k]) * V[j][k]

= <big><big>&Sigma;</big></big><sub>i &lt; k</sub>  (U[i][k] * sqrt(S[k][k])) * (sqrt(S[k][k]) * V[j][k])

= (U[i] * sqrt(S<sub>diag</sub>)<sup><sup>T</sup></sup>) * (V[j] * sqrt(S<sub>diag</sub>)<sup><sup>T</sup></sup>)<sup><sup>T</sup></sup>
</pre>

<h4>Calculating Values</h4>


<p>In the implementation <code>com.aliasi.matrix.SVDMatrix</code> of the matrix
interface <code>com.aliasi.matrix.Matrix</code>, the scaled row and column
vectors are stored.  For instance, here is the value of the <code>i</code>th
row vector after scaling by the square root of the singular values:
</p>

<pre class="code">
U[i] * sqrt(S<sub>diag</sub>)<sup><sup>T</sup></sup>
= { U[i][0] * sqrt(S[0][0]),
    U[i][1] * sqrt(S[1][1]),
    ...,
    U[i][k] * sqrt(S[k][k]) }
</pre>

<h4>Time and Space Requirements</h4>

<p>Thus extracting a value from an SVD matrix of order <code>k</code> requires
<code>k</code> multiplications and additions.  </p>

<p>The storage space required for an SVD representation of a matrix of
dimensionality <code>m &times; n</code> of order <code>k</code>
is <code>(n+m)*k</code> double values (of eight bytes each).</p>


<h2>Latent Semantic Analysis and Indexing</h2>

<p>Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a straightforward application of
singular value decomposition to term-document matrices.  Latent
semantic indexing (LSI) applies LSA to information retrieval.
To illustrate LSI, we implement the example from Deerwester
et al.'s original LSI paper (see the references below).
</p>

<h3>Running the Demo</h3>

<p>To run the example, simply invoke the Ant target <code>lsi</code>:
</p>

<pre class="code">

&gt; ant lsi

</pre>

<p>We'll explain all the output produced as we go through the code
and a brief explanation of how latent semantic indexing works
through SVD.</p>


<h3>Term-Document Matrix</h3>

<p>LSI begins with a term-document matrix.  The following 9 documents are
titles of technical reports.  We have taken the liberty of renumbering
them from 0 to 8.</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2" class="title">Documents (Deerwester et al. (1990), Table 2, Part 1)</th></tr>
<tr><th>Doc</th><th>Text</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Human machine interface for Lab ABC computer applications</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>A survey of user opinion of computer system response time</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The EPS user interface management system</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>System and human system engineering testing of EPS</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Relation of user-perceived response time to error measurement</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>The generation of random, binary, unordered trees</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>The intersection graph of paths in trees</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Graph minors IV: Widths of trees and well-quasi-ordering</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Graph minors: A survey</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The terms are just the words occurring in more than one document, with closed-class
words like &quot;and&quot; and &quot;to&quot; removed.  The words are normalized
for case by downcasing, but not otherwise stemmed or filtered.  The
terms may be the result of an arbitrary tokenization, including stemming,
stoplisting, case normalization, and even character n-grams.</p>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="10" class="title">Term-Document Matrix (Deerwester et al., Table 2, Part 2)&nbsp;</th></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="2">Term</th><th colspan="9">Document</th></tr>
<tr><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th></tr>

<tr><td>survey</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>trees</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>

<tr><td>minors</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The count of a term in a document here is just the raw frequency
count.  In applications of SVD, these counts are often weighted using
inverse document frequency and dampened using square roots or
logs.</p>




<h3>LSI Code</h3>

<p>The code for our LSI demo can be found in the file
<a href="src/Lsi.java"><code>src/Lsi.java</code></a>.  Because we
are only concerned with creating the single example, it is quite
compact.</p>

<p>The code starts by defining the term-document matrix
and the array of terms and documents themselves:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    static final String[] TERMS
        = new String[] {
        &quot;human&quot;,
        &quot;interface&quot;,
        &quot;computer&quot;,
        &quot;user&quot;,
        &quot;system&quot;,
        &quot;response&quot;,
        &quot;time&quot;,
        &quot;EPS&quot;,
        &quot;survey&quot;,
        &quot;trees&quot;,
        &quot;graph&quot;,
        &quot;minors&quot;
    };
</pre>

<pre class="code">
    static final String[] DOCS
        = new String[] {
        "Human machine interface for Lab ABC computer applications",
        "A survey of user opinion of computer system response time",
        "The EPS user interface management system",
        "System and human system engineering testing of EPS",
        "Relation of user-perceived response time to error measurement",
        "The generation of random, binary, unordered trees",
        "The intersection graph of paths in trees",
        "Graph minors IV: Widths of trees and well-quasi-ordering",
        "Graph minors: A survey"
    };
</pre>

<pre class="code">
    static final double[][] TERM_DOCUMENT_MATRIX
        = new double[][] {
            {1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
            {1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
            {1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
            {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
            {0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
            {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
            {0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
            {0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
            {0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 },
            {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0 },
            {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 },
            {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1 }
    };
</pre>

<p>There is a row for each term, with the columns
indexed by the document ID (0 to 8). The terms and
term-document matrix would obviously have to be
computed from the documents in a general application.
Here, we have just copied Deerwester et al.'s matrix
into a data structure by hand.  We only use the term
array and document array for display purposes.</p>

<p>We compute the singular value decomposition of the matrix
using the <code>svd()</code> method of <code>SvdMatrix</code>,
with the number of factors (latent semantic dimensions) set
in a constant (to 2, in this case, following Deerwester
et al.'s example):
</p>

<pre class="code">
static final int NUM_FACTORS = 2;

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    maxFactors = 2;
    double featureInit = 0.01;
    double initialLearningRate = 0.005;
    int annealingRate = 1000;
    double regularization = 0.00;
    double minImprovement = 0.0000;
    int minEpochs = 10;
    int maxEpochs = 50000;

    SvdMatrix matrix
        = SvdMatrix.svd(TERM_DOCUMENT_MATRIX,
                        maxFactors,
                        featureInit,
                        initialLearningRate,
                        annealingRate,
                        regularization,
                        null,
                        minImprovement,
                        minEpochs,
                        maxEpochs);
        ...
</pre>

<p>The final argument is <code>null</code>, which turns
off feedback from the SVD solver during the solution process.
We discuss what it outputs and how to tune SVD in the
next sections on complete and partial SVD.</p>

<p>We print the output vectors for the two-dimensional
SVD we have computed.  The singular values, left
singular vectors and right singular values are extracted
from the SVD matrix:</p>

<pre class="code">
        double[] scales = matrix.singularValues();
        double[][] termVectors = matrix.leftSingularVectors();
        double[][] docVectors = matrix.rightSingularVectors();
</pre>

<p>We do not repeat the code here to print out these arrays,
but here's what the demo program prints:
</p>

clustering documents or relating terms to documents.  </p>

<p>Next we consider the search component of latent semantic indexing.
Queries are computed by taking the centroid of the term
vectors corresponding to the terms in the query.  For instance,
Deerwester et al. use the query &quot;human computer interaction&quot;
for illustration, and we repeat their example here.  Only the terms
&quot;human&quot; and &quot;computer&quot; show up.  The centroid's
computed pointwise, by adding the values in each dimension:
</p>

<pre class="code">
human            computer
(0.22, -0.11) + (0.24, 0.04) = (0.46, -0.07)
</pre>

<p>
This is then matched against the document vectors using the scaling
provided by the singular values, with the following result:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Query=[human, computer, interaction]
Query Vector=( 0.46, -0.07 )

DOCUMENT SCORES VS. QUERY
  0:  0.31  Human machine interface for Lab ABC computer applications
  1:  0.91  A survey of user opinion of computer system response time
  2:  0.74  The EPS user interface management system
  3:  0.88  System and human system engineering testing of EPS
  4:  0.41  Relation of user-perceived response time to error measurement

  7: -0.07  Graph minors IV: Widths of trees and well-quasi-ordering
  8:  0.03  Graph minors: A survey
</pre>

<p>As noted by Deerwester et al., document 2 and document 4, neither
of which contain any of the search terms, score relatively high.  This
is b
ecause of second-order relations between terms, such as the term
&quot;user&quot; showing up in the related documents.  If we were
to match the query vector to terms, we get the following related
query terms:
</p>

<pre class="code">
TERM SCORES VS. QUERY
  0:  0.36  human
  1:  0.32  interface
  2:  0.36  computer
  3:  0.61  user
  4:  1.02  system
  5:  0.39  response
  6:  0.39  time
  7:  0.49  EPS
  8:  0.27  survey
  9: -0.07  trees
  10: -0.05  graph
  11: -0.03  minors
</pre>

<p>Note that the query &quot;human computer interaction&quot; supplies
terms &quot;human&quot; and &quot;computer&quot; which are both judged
reasonably close to the query itself, which is the centroid of the
vectors for &quot;human&quot; and &quot;interface&quot;.  More interestingly,
terms such as &quot;interface&quot; and &quot;system&quot; are also
close to the query in latent semantic space.
</p>

<p>Given the indexing (the singular value decomposition, that is), it
is straightforward to compute these scorings.  Here is the code
from <a href="src/Lsi.java"><code>src/Lsi.java</code></a>.
</p>

<pre class="code">
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    ...
    SvdMatrix matrix
        = SvdMatrix.svd(TERM_DOCUMENT_MATRIX,
    ...
    double[] scales = matrix.singularValues();
    double[][] termVectors = matrix.leftSingularVectors();
    double[][] docVectors = matrix.rightSingularVectors();
    ...
    for (int m = 0; m &lt; args.length; ++m)
        search(scales,termVectors,docVectors,args[m]);
</pre>

<p>We just iterate through the arguments and search relative
to the indexing.  Here's the search method:
</p>

<pre class="code">
static void search(double[] scales,
                   double[][] termVectors,
                   double[][] docVectors,
                   String arg) {

    String[] terms = arg.split(" |,"); // space or comma separated
    double[] queryVector = new double[NUM_FACTORS];
    Arrays.fill(queryVector,0.0);
    for (String term : terms)
        addTermVector(term,termVectors,queryVector);
    ...
</pre>

<p>The code first finds the terms by splitting on spaces or
commas.  It then initializes the query vector to be the number
of dimensions in the latent semantic space, that is, the number
of factors in the SVD.  It then iterates over the terms and adds
their term vectors to the query vector.  The addition's done
by brute force, looking for the term in the list of terms and
then adding its vector if found.  If the term isn't found in the
array of terms, it's ignored.
</p>

<pre class="code">
static void addTermVector(String term, double[][] termVectors, double[] queryVector) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; TERMS.length; ++i) {
        if (TERMS[i].equals(term)) {
            for (int j = 0; j &lt; NUM_FACTORS; ++j) {
                queryVector[j] += termVectors[i][j];
            }
            return;
         }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Finally, the query vector is printed (we do not repeat that code) and
then scored against the document and term vectors:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    System.out.println("DOCUMENT SCORES VS. QUERY");
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; docVectors.length; ++j) {
        double score = dotProduct(queryVector,docVectors[j],scales);
        System.out.printf("  %d: % 5.2f  %s\n",j,score,DOCS[j]);
    }

    System.out.println("TERM SCORES VS. QUERY");
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; termVectors.length; ++i) {
        double score = dotProduct(queryVector,termVectors[i],scales);
        System.out.printf("  %d: % 5.2f  %s\n",i,score,TERMS[i]);
    }
</pre>

<p>Dot product is computed relative to the scales as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code">
static double dotProduct(double[] xs, double[] ys, double[] scales) {
    double sum = 0.0;
    for (int k = 0; k &lt; xs.length; ++k)
        sum += xs[k] * ys[k] * scales[k];
    return sum;
}
</pre>

<p>It's common to replace the dot product measure of similarity
with a cosine ordering.  That would look like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
static double cosine(double[] xs, double[] ys, double[] scales) {
    double product = 0.0;
    double xsLengthSquared = 0.0;
    double ysLengthSquared = 0.0;
    for (int k = 0; k &lt; xs.length; ++k) {
        double sqrtScale = Math.sqrt(scales[k]);
        double scaledXs = sqrtScale * xs[k];
        double scaledYs = sqrtScale * ys[k];
        xsLengthSquared += scaledXs * scaledXs;
        ysLengthSquared += scaledYs * scaledYs;
        product += scaledXs * scaledYs;
    }
    return product / Math.sqrt(xsLengthSquared * ysLengthSquared);
}
</pre>

<p>Cosine-based scores are as follows (with dot-product scores reproduced
in parens for convenience):
</p>

<p>Note that cosine changes the actual ranking of results as well as
the relative scores.  Euclidean distance or other distance measures
would be a third way to measure.  Dot product is the most natural for
the underlying linear model implied by the use of singular value
decomposition.</p>

<p>And that's it.  A complete demo implementation of
latent semantic indexing in a few lines of code.

<h2>Complete Matrix SVD</h2>

<p>The API is set up to allow easy calculation of SVDs for a complete
matrix, that is, one where every value is known.  There is a single
method call, but the method requires a slew of fairly sensitive arguments,
the effects of which we will endeavour to illustrate in this section.
Before doing that, let's get an example up and running.</p>

<h3>Complete SVD for Token Bigrams</h3>

<p>For our first exercise, we will simply look at bigram counts in
textual data.  Bigram counts are asymmetric; for example, &quot;of the&quot;
occurs much more frequently than &quot;the of&quot; in English.
</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Replicating Gorrell</h2>
<p>
This demo replicates the NLP application in Genevieve Gorrell's
<a href="http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/eacl2006/main/papers/05_1_gorrell_176.pdf">2005 EACL paper</a> on stochastic gradient descent for SVD
(see <a href="#references">references</a> below for a full citation).
</p>
</div>

<h4>The Code</h4>
<p>
The code may be found in the standalone
demo code file <a href="src/TokenBigramSvd.java"><code>src/TokenBigramSvd.java</code></a>.
</p>

<h4>Downloading <span style="font-style:normal">Pride and Prejudice</span></h4>

<p>Before we can run, we need text data.  We chose to analyze Jane
Austen's early 19th century English novel, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.
It may be downloaded from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>
from:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1342"><b>Overview:</b> <i>Pride and Prejudice</i></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/pandp12.txt"><b>Text: </b> <i>Pride and Prejudice</i></a> [700KB ASCII]</li>
</ul>

<p>After downloading, place the text in a file, which we'll call
<code>$TEXT_FILE</code>.  We suggest editing out the top of the file,
which is the Project Gutenberg header.  It always helps to start with clean data.
You may use texts other than <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, of course.
</p>

<h3>Running the Demo</h3>


<h4>Running from Ant</h4>

<p>The demo may be run directly from ant, with the path to the
text data file supplied on the command line:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&gt; cd $LINGPIPE/demos/tutorial/svd
&gt; ant -Dtext.file=e:\data\gutenberg\dist\JaneAusten\PrideAndPrejudice.txt tokenBigram
...
</pre>


<h4>Parameter Report</h4>

<p>The first thing the program does is report all of its parameters.
Other than the file name, these are hardcoded into the program and
reported here for convenience.

<h4>Factor- and Epoch-Level Report</h4>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Your Results <i>Will</i> Vary</h2>
<p>
Because of the random initialization of the
singular vectors, the exact sequence of RMSE
values and even the results may vary between
runs.  Run several times to guarantee convergence
if there is any doubt.
</p>
</div>

<p>After the report, the iterative SVD solver comes into
play.  The factors are computed one at a time.  For each
factor, the entire matrix is visited several times.  Each
loop through the data is referred to as an &quot;epoch&quot;.
The number of epochs is bounded below and above by parameters
passed to SVD.  The SVD method may be enabled for online
reporting, which we have done here.  Reports from the SVD
solver are preceded by &quot;<code>partialSvd|</code>&quot;.
It reports when each factor is started and root mean square
error for the current factorization (involving the current
factor and all previous factors).

<p>Note that as the epochs progress, error is gradually reduced.  The
algorithm is actually guaranteed to find the unique solution (up to
ordering, signs and arithmetic precision) if allowed enough epochs
with an appropriate learning rate (more on these tuning parameters
below).  We have specified a maximum of 200 epochs, at which point
RMSE is only decreasing in the 5th or 6th decimal place.  We see that
with one factor, the original matrix was reconstructed with RMSE of
0.192, with two factors, RMSE is 0.175 and with three factors, 0.158.
With as many factors as the minimum dimension of the input matrix,
RMSE will converge to zero (we show this with some small artificial
examples below).</p>

<h4>Results: Factors</h4>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Two Negatives Make a Positive</h2>
<p>
Your results <b>will</b> vary.  They might even be negative.
That is, the extremely
low values may have non-zero values instead of the
positive ones.  For real numbers, two negatives
do make a positive, at least when multiplied.
</p>
</div>

<p>After computing the SVD, our demo program reports on the
singular values and vectors it has found.  Following Gorrell's
paper, we report singular values along with the largest and
smallest values in the left and right singular vectors.  These
are labeled by the token. Here's the report for the first factor:</p>

<p>The first singular value is 985, which is very high for this corpus,
where average counts are quite low.
This says that the first factor provides high
counts to bigrams with first words &quot;of&quot;,
&quot;to&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, and &quot;and&quot;,
and with second words like &quot;the&quot;,
&quot;her&quot;, and &quot;be&quot;.
</p>
<p>
As the report below shows,
&quot;of the&quot; is the most common bigram in Jane Austen's
text, with a count of only 461.  If we used only the first
factor to predict, we would predict &quot;of the&quot; to
have a count of <code>0.614 * 0.742 * 985.0 = 448</code>,
which is pretty close to the empirical corpus count of 461.
This is not surprising, as the first factor will always account
for the largest patterns in the data.  It further predicts
that &quot;to the&quot; has a high corpus count, but
only 0.441/0.614 as high as &quot;of the&quot;.  Similarly
&quot;of her&quot; is predicted to have a count that's
only 0.373/0.742 as high as &quot;of the&quot;.
</p>

<p>Subsequent factors are required to be orthogonal to the
first dimension.  They are also required to have singular
values that are equally sized or smaller than previous factors.
Here's the second factor report:

<p>Note that it not only adds positive counts for good bigrams
like &quot;she had&quot;, but positive counts bad bigrams
like &quot;she be&quot;.  Remember, this is just an approximation,
and it's being driven by least squares, not linguistic theory.
</p>

<p>What's interesting to note is that there are large
negative dimensions in this factor.  But remember the
signs.  These values will reduce estimates for
bigrams like &quot;I her&quot; and &quot;for was&quot;,
but will actually increase counts in cases where both
values are negative, such as &quot;in his&quot;.</p>

<p>The third singular value is also high, at 488.6, which means
the factor is still quite significant.  As the singular values decrease,
so does the effect of the dimension.  In factor 2, we see left tokens
making up subject
nouns like &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; (and &quot;that&quot; used
as a subject relative), and right tokens making up auxiliaries and
object nouns, which is rather difficult to interpret.  Also note the
high negative values, which accounts for the special behavior of
auxiliaries like &quot;be&quot;.  Here we remove the counts
for &quot;she be&quot;, correcting an estimation error incurred by the
first two factors alone.</p>

<h4>Results: Reconstruction</h4>

<p>Finally, with just the three factors, here is how well the original
values are reconstructed for the token pairs with the highest counts
in the training data:

<p>Note that some bigrams are reconstructed accurately, whereas others
are way off.  Remember that square error is the metric.  For
instance, the original count of &quot;to be&quot; is 436, the
reconstructed count is 393, so the difference is 436-393=43, for
a contribution to square error of 43*43=1849 (recall this is divided
by the number of positions in the matrix to determine mean square
error, the square root of which is reported as RMSE in the epoch reports).
</p>

<h4>Comparison with Gorrell's Results</h4>

<p>Gorrell started with a matrix of bigram counts just as we did.
But she normalized the vectors to a probability scale.  Here's her
report of the top dimensions of the first two factors:
</p>

<p>This is close enough that we may assume that it's the
text source leading to the difference.  Of course, this illustrates
the variability of texts; if <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> had
the same bigram counts as <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, the results
would've been identical.</p>

<h3>Inspecting the Code</h3>

<p>The code for generating the SVD is quite simple.  Most of
the work's in I/O as there's only one method call for SVD.  Here's
the top-level command implementation from
<a href="src/TokenBigramSvd.java"><code>src/TokenBigramSvd.java</code></a>:
</p>

<pre class="code">
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    File textFile = new File(args[0]);
    MapSymbolTable symbolTable = new MapSymbolTable();
    TokenizerFactory tokenizerFactory = IndoEuropeanTokenizerFactory.FACTORY;
    String charset = &quot;ASCII&quot;;
    double[][] values = extractBigrams(textFile,symbolTable,tokenizerFactory,charset);

    int maxFactors = 3;
    double featureInit = 0.1;
    double initialLearningRate = 0.001;
    int annealingRate = 10;
    double regularization = 0.00;
    double minImprovement = 0.000000;
    int minEpochs = 10;
    int maxEpochs = 200;
    PrintWriter verbosePrintWriter
        = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out,charset));
    Reporter reporter
        = Reporters.writer(verbosePrintWriter).setLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG);

    SvdMatrix matrix
        = SvdMatrix.svd(values,
                        maxFactors,
                        featureInit,
                        initialLearningRate,
                        annealingRate,
                        regularization,
                        reporter,
                        minImprovement,
                        minEpochs,
                        maxEpochs);

    reportSvd(values,matrix,symbolTable);
}
</pre>

<p>The first batch of code here simply extracts a matrix of bigram
counts from the specified text file and assigns it to the variable
<code>values</code>.  This requires a tokenizer factory.  As it works,
it the bigram extractor populates a symbol table mapping the tokens to
the dimensions of the matrix; this is used later for output reporting,
but otherwise does not come into play in the SVD computation.</p>

<p>The second group of statements simply sets all the parameters for
the run.  We will explain these in detail shortly.</p>

<p>Next is the actual SVD computation, which is handled by a call
to the static method <code>svd()</code>, which is found in the
<code>com.aliasi.matrix.SvdMatrix</code> class.  The result is
an instance of the class <code>SvdMatrix</code>.  As we mentioned
earlier, the <code>SvdMatrix</code> class implements the
<code>Matrix</code> interface by storing the scaled singular vectors
and using them to compute values at run time.</p>

<p>Note that we have created an instance of <code>com.aliasi.io.Reporter</code>
using a static factory method in <code>com.aliasi.io.Reporters</code>,
and then set its log level (<code>com.aliasi.io.LogLevel</code>) to
the enum value <code>DEBUG</code>.  This is passed in to the
SVD process to provide feedback on the progress of the optimizer.
The argument may be <code>null</code> for no reporting, or reports
can be sent to files, standard output, etc.</p>

<p>The final piece of the code reports on the resulting SVD
matrix using the original array of values and symbol table.</p>

<pre class="code">
static void reportSvd(double[][] values,
                      SvdMatrix matrix,
                      MapSymbolTable symbolTable) {
    double[] singularValues = matrix.singularValues();
    double[][] leftSingularVectors = matrix.leftSingularVectors();
    double[][] rightSingularVectors = matrix.rightSingularVectors();
    for (int order = 0; order &lt; singularValues.length; ++order) {
        System.out.println(&quot;\n\nFACTOR=&quot; + order + &quot; singular value=&quot; + singularValues[order]);

        System.out.println(&quot;Extreme Left Values&quot;);
        extremeValues(leftSingularVectors,order,symbolTable);

        System.out.println(&quot;\nExtreme Right Values&quot;);
        extremeValues(rightSingularVectors,order,symbolTable);
    }
    ...
</pre>

<p>The first thing the report method does is pull out the vector of
singular values and matrices of singular vectors.  We then just walk
through the factors (the dimensionality of all three arrays) and
report on the singular value and extreme values.  The extreme values
computation is straightforward.  It uses our convenience class
<code>util.ObjectToDoubleMap</code> to create a map from symbol to
counts, and then simply reports on the top values.  Note that the
symbol table is required to map the dimension <code>i</code> back
to a symbol <code>token</code>.
</p>
<pre class="code">
static void extremeValues(double[][] values,
                          int order,
                          MapSymbolTable symbolTable) {

    ObjectToDoubleMap&lt;String&gt; topVals = new ObjectToDoubleMap&lt;String&gt;();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; values.length; ++i) {
        String token = symbolTable.idToSymbol(i);
        topVals.set(token,values[i][order]);
    }

    List&lt;String&gt; tokensByValue = topVals.keysOrderedByValueList();
    int size = tokensByValue.size();

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10 &amp;&amp; i &lt; size; ++i) {
        String token = tokensByValue.get(i);
        double value = topVals.getValue(token);
        System.out.printf(&quot;     %6d %-15s % 5.3f\n&quot;,i,token,value);
    }

    System.out.println(&quot;...&quot;);

    for (int i = 10; --i &gt;= 0; ) {
        String token = tokensByValue.get(size-i-1);
        double value = topVals.getValue(token);
        System.out.printf(&quot;     %6d %-15s % 5.3f\n&quot;,size-i-1,token,value);
    }
}
</pre>

<h3>Utility Features</h3>

<h4>Maximum Order</h4>

<p>Specifying the maximum number of factors allows SVDs with
relatively small numbers of factors (compared to the rank of
the matrix) to be computed without computing the entire SVD.
This should simply be determined by how close the approximation
is.  Using fewer factors leads to more smoothing, that is
a less exact approximation, of the underlying matrix.  For
large-scale NLP problems, such as latent semantic indexing,
typical values are around 100.
</p>

<h4>PrintWriter</h4>

<p>A print writer may be supplied or it may be left null.  If
it's supplied, the SVD algorithm reports each factor and each
epoch back to the printer.</p>


<h3>Regularization</h3>

<p>The regularization parameter places a penalty on the
size of singular values.  Directly, it places a penalty on
the magnitude of the incremental singular vector dimensions,
which has the result of reducing singular values in the end.
</p>

<p>The regularization parameter is important for two reasons.
The first reason is that it makes ill-conditioned
problems well-behaved.  An ill-conditioned SVD problem arises
when two dimensions of the input matrix are highly correlated
(in the worst case, linear multiple of each other, for a
correlation of 1.0).  Ill-conditioned matrices cause uncertainty
in numerical solvers as there is little constraint on the
magnitudes of the dimensions.</p>

<p>The second reason regularization is important is to reduce
overfitting.  Without regularization, the solver may work
very hard to fit quirky facts of the data.  With regularization,
that becomes expensive, as it requires large values in singular
vectors.
</p>


<h3>Learning and Convergence Features</h3>

<p>Feature initialization, learning rates, and annealing rate
primarily affect the convergence of the algorithm.
</p>



<h4>Feature Initialization</h4>
<p>
The initial value of all positions in the singular vectors
are given by the feature initialization value.  The value
should be set so that there is a finite RMSE, and ideally
so that the RMSE after training epochs is as low as possible.
</p>

<p>Initial Learning Rate</p>
<p>
The initial learning rate determines how quickly the singular
vectors move to reduce their error.  If the rate is too low,
it will take too many epochs to move in the right direction.
If the rate is too high, the algorithm will overshoot the
target and oscillate rather than converging.
</p>

<p>Let's consider some examples.  If we set the learning
rate down to 0.01, we cannot even get off the ground:
</p>
<pre class="code">
...
    initialLearningRate=0.01
...
partialSvd|   Factor=0
partialSvd|     epoch=0 rmse=NaN
</pre>

<p>
If we start with a smaller learning rate, such
as 0.0001, that is, 1.0E-4, convergence is too slow.
Here's the RMSE after ten epochs for learning
rate 0.0001, with the results for learning rate 0.001
in parentheses.
</p>

<pre class="code">
...
     initialLearningRate=1.0E-4 (0.001)
...
partialSvd|   Factor=0
...
partialSvd|     epoch=10 rmse=0.2426697687009369 (0.19438242531824138)
</pre>

<p>This illustrates how we narrow down the acceptable
values for parameters.  Here we have determined that
0.01 is too fast a learning rate and 0.0001 too slow
a learning rate.  We could put more effort in to
determine how close 0.001 is to optimal, but we have
not done so for this tutorial.</p>

<h4>Simulated Annealing</h4>



<p>
The annealing rate determines how quickly the learning rate
is lowered.  If it is set too low, the learning rate may
be lowered too quickly and there may not be enough epochs for
the factor to move to its correct value.  If the annealing
rate is set too high, the learning rate may not be lowered
quickly enough to converge tightly on the proper value.
</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Why's it Called &quot;Annealing&quot;?</h2>
<p>
The standard use of &quot;annealing&quot; is
for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_%28metallurgy%29">metallurgical
process</a> in which steel is heated and then gradually
cooled to increase its hardness.
</p>
<p>If we think of our factors as metal, and the
learning rate as the temperature, then lowering the
learning rate gradually corresponds to annealing.
This approach is so widely used that it's called
&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing">simulated annealing</a>&quot; to
distinguish it from the physical process.
</p>
</div>



<p>
The learning rate in an epoch is a fraction of
the learning rate proportional to the epoch.  The value is
the number of epochs required to increment the denominator.
With an annealing rate of 10, then after 10 epochs, the
learning rate is 1/(1+1) = 1/2 of its original value.
After 20 epochs, the rate is 1/(1+2), and so on.  After
90 epochs, the rate is 1/(1+9) = 1/10th of its original
magnitude.  After 990 epochs, the rate is 1/100th of
its original magnitude and so on.
</p>

<p>We started with an annealing rate of 10, which is very
agressive in that the temperature cools very quickly.
If we set the annealing rate even faster, say to 1,
we won't converge fast enough.  Here's an example run
with the rate set to 1 (and the original rate 10 shown
in parentheses):</p>

<pre class="code">
...
    annealingRate=1 (10)
...
partialSvd|     epoch=10 rmse=0.23664566796409153 (0.19438242531824138)
...
partialSvd|     epoch=199 rmse=0.1925776063676676 (0.19184783367034072)
</pre>

<p>We are not converging fast enough with the annealing rate
set so low (that is, fast).</p>

<p>If we set the annealing rate to 100, the temperature
will cool much more slowly (again shown with the original
annealing rate of 10 shown in parens).</p>

<pre class="code">
     annealingRate=100 (10)
...
partialSvd|     epoch=10 rmse=0.19589718967682496   (0.19438242531824138)
...
partialSvd|     epoch=199 rmse=0.19314865895356362  (0.19184783367034072)
</pre>

<p>Here, the temperature remains too high to converge to
a stable solution.  As with the other parameters,
experimentation (i.e. trial and error) is the best guide.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that the values of learning rate and annealing
rate are highly dependent on one another.  As the learning
rate goes up (higher temperature), the annealing rate may go down
(faster cooling).
</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Chocolate is not Steel</h2>
<p>The process of
<a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/article/155/Tempering-Chocolate">tempering chocolate</a>
used for making candy is a form of annealing.  It just happens at a much
lower temperature than annealing steel.
</p>
<p>
 The right initial temperature and
cooling schedule is required for each problem.
This requires experimentation, otherwise known
as &quot;trial and error&quot;.
</p>
</div>


<p>Minimum Improvement and Stopping</p>

<p>
The minimum and maximum number of epochs control the
number of epochs used in exactly the way suggested by their names.
</p>

<p>The minimum improvement value is the relative reduction
in root mean square error (RMSE) required to continue to the
next epoch.  If an epoch's work doesn't lower the RMSE by
the percentage indicated, the loop exits and the factor is
considered complete.</p>

<p>Setting the minimum improvement to 0.0 means that the
maximum number of epochs will always be used.  If the minimum
improvement is set too high, say 0.1, then the singular
vectors won't be oriented in the correct directions and
the singular value won't have the correct magnitude.  The
value should be set as high as possible for the precision
desired.</p>

<p>Using all the same parameters as above, setting
the minImprovement value to 0.0001 leads to fewer
loops:</p>

<pre class="code">

</pre>

<p>Note that the final RMSE is 0.1587, which is much higher than the 0.1576
RMSE of the run allowed 200 epochs per factor.  This reflects stopping
before convergence (as does the previous run, in fact), so the singular values
and vectors are slightly different.  For instance, here's the first
singular vector's extreme values (with the original 200 epoch per factor
run's values in parens):</p>

<pre class="code">
...
     minImprovement=1.0E-4  (0.000)

</pre>

<p>It's clear the answer is in roughly the same ballpark.  The other
factors are similarly close, though they vary more as the order increases.
Whether or not the exact singular values matter is going to be application
dependent.  Often, computing more exact answers is not necessary.</p>


<h2>Regularization by Shrinkage</h2>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Why all these Squares?</h2>
<p>
I (Bob) remember sitting around the Carnegie Mellon Uni philosophy
department lunchroom over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chana_masala">chana masala</a>
and asking the assembled
statistical wizards (e.g. <a href="http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-glymour.php">Clark Glymour</a>,
<a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/">Chris Manning</a>, and
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~meek/meek.htm">Chris Meek</a>), "Why all the squares?".
They told me it was how the math worked out.
</p>
<p>It took me a few more years to understand which
math they meant and why it always seemed to work out
to squares.
</p>
<p>The math in question in many cases is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central
limit theorem</a>.  The math in question here is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation">partial
different equations</a>.  There's a deeper connection of least
squares to minimizing normal distribution estimation error, but
we'll put that aside for now.</p>
<p>The reason we like square error is that we are
looking for solutions or estimates that minimize error.
We know the  minimum, if there is one, will occur where
all the partial derivatives are zero.  If the error is
a quadratic function in the parameters, then the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient">gradient</a>, which is the collection of partial derivatives
of the error with respect to the parameters,
is a linear function in the parameters.  We know how to
solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations">systems of linear equations</a>.  We can
whip out some algebra, or use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">stochastic gradient
descent</a>, as in LingPipe's implementation of SVD.
We even know there's a solution because multivariate
quadratics are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function">convex</a>.
</p>
<p>
In our case, the parameters are the singular values
and singular vectors.
</p>
</div>

<p>Regularized singular value decomposition optimizes a slightly
different scoring function than standard SVD.  The standard variety
finds the solution with the least square error of any orthogonal
factorization for any given order.  At the order equal to the rank
of the matrix (number of linearly independent rows and columns),
the standard SVD returns an exact factorization (up to arithmetic
precision and estimate convergence iterations).</p>

<p>Regularized SVD considers not only squared error from the original
matrix values, but also the size of the singular values.  It provides
the square of the singular values times the shrinkage factor as an
additional error term.  In simpler terms, it penalizes large singular
values proportionally to the square of their length.
Regularized SVD thus minimizes the combined error: least squares
plus squared singular values.
</p>

<p>With linear regression, problems may be ill-conditioned if
there are linear dependencies among the input vectors.  Regularization
is often used to overcome this problem.  Ill-conditioning does not
cause a problem for our stochastic gradient descent SVD solver.</p>

<p>Linear regression often overfits a set of training data.  To
compensate for overfitting, regularization is often used to reduce
the magnitude of the regression coefficients.  This use corresponds
to the use in SVD.</p>

<p>Finally, regularization is able to eliminate dimensions, much like
non-parametric process models, such as the Dirichlet process prior for
a multinomial of unknown dimensionality.  Like the process priors,
regularization may be interpreted as a prior on the size of
singular values.
</p>

<p>The exact definition of regularization is found in the class
documentation for <code>SvdMatrix</code>, which also contains
references to textbook presentations of regularization.</p>

<h2>AKA: Ridge Regression, Weight Decay, MDL</h2>
<p>
Adding a penalty for parameter length is also known
as <i>ridge regression</i> in the machine learning
literature and as <i>weight decay</i> in the
neural networks literature.  It is also a form
of minimum description length (MDL) learning
where we have encoded the length of the singular
values.
</p>
</div>

<p>The are two properties supplied by command line, the
regularization parameter and the maximum number of epochs to run.
With 100,000 epochs, the SVD completes in under a second with
an accurate reconstruction.  </p>

<p>The code is just like our other cases, so we do not repeat it
here. It may be found in the file <a
href="src/RegularizedSvd.java"><code>src/RegularizedSvd.java</code></a>.
</p>

<p>Let's see what happens when we keep our matrix the same,
but change the regularization parameter.  With a value of
0.01, the output is:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&gt; ant -D<b>regularization=0.01</b> -DmaxEpochs=100000 regularized
...
Singular Values
 k=0  value=    278.43

   0.99,    8.01,   26.95,  -64.00
  -1.00,  -16.00,  -81.00,  255.96
</pre>

<p>The reconstruction is not as accurate, and the
singular values ar ea bit smaller.  Now let's look
at 0.1 and 1.0:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&gt; ant -D<b>regularization=0.1</b> -DmaxEpochs=100000 regularized
...
Singular Values
 k=0  value=    278.08
 k=1  value=      8.60
 k=2  value=      0.63
 k=3  value=      0.00

   0.91,    3.75,    8.93,  -16.01
   1.08,    7.95,   26.63,  -64.02
  -0.99,  -16.01,  -80.97,  255.61
</pre>

<p>And here is with regularization of 1.0:</p>

<pre class="code">
&gt; ant -D<b>regularization=1.0</b> -DmaxEpochs=100000 regularized
...
Singular Values
 k=0  value=    274.54
 k=1  value=      5.00
 k=2  value=      0.00

  -1.06,  -16.24,  -80.61,  252.11
</pre>

<p>The reconstruction becomes less and less exact as the
regularization goes up.  B the time the regularization
is 1.0, there are only two factors being returned.  The
third and forth singular values are zero. With a regularization
of 10, we are down to a single factor:</p>

<pre class="code">
&gt; ant -D<b>regularization=10.0</b> -DmaxEpochs=100000 regularized

Singular Values
 k=0  value=    239.02

   0.28,    3.80,   18.35,  -56.67
  -1.07,  -14.70,  -70.96,  219.21
</pre>

<p>It is an empirical matter in an application to see
whether regularization helps or not.</p>

<h3>Scaling Inputs</h3>

<p>Although standard SVD is invariant under the scaling of
the input matrix, regularized regression is not.  That is,
if we rescale the inputs and leave the scaling factor
the same, we get answers that are different (and not just
different by the scaling factors).  A typical kind of
scaling is normalizing to Z-scores.  This might be done
per-row, per-column, or for the whole matrix, depending
on the kind of application.  Note that the Z-score conversion
is not linear.  Then the SVD is taken of
the transformed matrix, and the results converted back
using an inverse z-score.    For a single problem, this
doesn't matter.  One can simply choose an appropriate
regularization parameter.  But if you are fitting a regularization
parameter across problems, a Z-score conversion is likely
in order.
</p>





<h2>Partial Matrix SVD</h2>

<p>The real strength of stochastic gradient descent is that
it allows SVDs to be computed for partial matrices.   A partial
matrix is one where some values are unknown.  LingPipe's
gradient descent solver works by minimizing the square error
between the SVD reconstructed matrix and the known values.
</p>

<h3>Representing Partial Matrices</h3>
<p>
We represent a partial matrix <code>A</code> using
a pair of parallel two-dimensional matrices:
</p>

<pre class="code">
int[][] columnIndexes;
double[][] values;
</pre>

<p>
The arrays <code>values[i]</code> and <code>columnIndexes[i]</code>
represent the <code>i</code>-th row of the partial matrix.
Thus <code>values.length</code> must be the same as
<code>columnIndexes.length</code>, namely the number of rows
in the partial matrix.  The array <code>columnIndexes[i]</code>
represents the columns taking values <code>values[i]</code>.
That is, the original matrix takes values:
</p>

<pre class="code">
A[i][columnIndexes[i][j]] = values[i][j]
</pre>

<p>Thus for each row <code>i</code>,
<code>columnIndexes[i]</code> and <code>values[i]</code>
must be the same length.
</p>

<h4>Worked Example</h4>

<p>
Suppose we have a 3 &times; 4 partial matrix:
</p>

<pre class="code">
A = { { 1, ?, 2, 5 },   A[0][0] = 1;  A[0][2] = 2; A[0][3] = 5;
      { ?, ?, 9, ? },   A[1][2] = 9;
      { 3, 7, ?, ? } }  A[2][0] = 3;  A[2][1] = 7
</pre>

<p>We use <code>?</code> to indicate unknown values.  This
partial matrix would be represented by the following pair of
parallel arrays:
</p>

<pre class="code">
columnIndexes = { { 0, 2, 3 },
                  { 2 },
                  { 0, 1 } }

values= { { 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 },
          { 9.0 },
          { 3.0, 7.0 } }
</pre>


<h3>Example of Partial SVD</h3>

<p>We will illustrate partial matrix SVD using the same
data as for full matrix SVD, but we'll cheat.  We'll consider
all the zero values as unknown, rather than as zero.  The effect of
ignoring zero entries is that we will not consider the error on
bigrams with zero counts in fitting the SVD.
</p>

<p>The code for the partial SVD is in <a
href="src/PartialTokenBigramSvd.java"><code>src/PartialTokenBigram.svd</code></a>.
The only difference is in how the inputs are computed and which SVD method is called.  We start with the same complete two-dimensional array <code>values</code> of counts, only this time they are transformed into a partial
array representation:
</p>

<pre class="code">
double[][] values
    = TokenBigramSvd
      .extractBigrams(textFile,symbolTable,tokenizerFactory,charset);
int[][] columnIds = columnIds(values);
double[][] partialValues = partialValues(values);
</pre>

<p>
The <code>columnIds()</code> and <code>partialValues()</code> methods are
similar, so we only show one here:
</p>

<pre class="code">
static int[][] columnIds(double[][] values) {
    int[][] columnIds = new int[values.length][];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; values.length; ++i)
        columnIds[i] = columnIdsRow(values[i]);
    return columnIds;
}

static int[] columnIdsRow(double[] values) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; values.length; ++i)
        if (values[i] != 0)
            ++count;
    int[] columnIdsRow = new int[count];

    count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; values.length; ++i)
        if (values[i] != 0)
            columnIdsRow[count++] = i;
    return columnIdsRow;
}
</pre>

<p>The only substantial difference with the values computation is
that arrays of double precision floating point are allocated and
the assignment in the innermost loop is:
</p>

<pre class="code">
static double[] partialValuesRow(double[] values) {
...
        if (values[i] != 0)
            partialValuesRow[count++] = values[i];
...
</pre>

<p>Then, a call is made to the partial SVD method:</p>

<pre class="code">
    SvdMatrix matrix
        = SvdMatrix.partialSvd(columnIds,
                               partialValues,
                               maxFactors,
...
</pre>

<p>We have ellided all the other arguments as they are
exactly the same as for the complete matrix method
<code>svd()</code>.  The report on the resulting SVD matrix
is the same.  We have used similar, though not identical
parameters (see the program run's report for values):

<p>Overall root mean square error (RMSE) is higher,
but that is largely because we are only measuring
on the non-zero entries.</p>

<p>Because there is no penalty for estimating unseen
bigrams as any values, the singular vectors have far
less bigram coherence:</p>

<p>The better estimation of high count pairs comes at a cost -- we do

<h2>Comparison with Algebraic SVD Solvers</h2>
<p>
Standard algebraic SVD solvers, such as those found in
popular matrix libraries (see the book by Strang
or the Wikipedia article in the references) require cubic time
to solve in the dimensionality of the matrix.  Standard solvers
are numerically unstable, but this problem may be overcome
with regularization.  The biggest problem for standard solvers
is that they don't apply to partial matrices.
</p>

<p>
LingPipe's SVD solver uses stochastic gradient descent.
This algorithm requires a an amount of arithmetic effort
bounded by the maximum number of epochs times the number of
matrix entries times the number of factors.  For full matrices,
the number of entries is quadratic and the number of epochs
is usually a relatively small constant like 200.  If a
full rank decomposition is required, we are still stuck
with a cubic algorithm.  But if we only require the first
k factors, we have an <code>O(k * n<sup>2</sup>)</code>
algorithm, where <code>k</code> is the number of factors
and <code>n</code> is the number of dimensions.  If the
matrix is partial, the <code>n<sup>2</sup></code> factor
is really just the number of defined entries.
</p>

<p>
There are better techniques than stochastic gradient descent for
solving full-rank singular value decompositions on modestly
sized matrices.  These algorithms are cubic in the dimensionality
of the matrix, so are prohibitive for large matrices.  Such
algorithms are not necessary if a low order approximation is
desired.  The gradient descent algorithm finds a single factor
at a time with a few hundred steps per entry per factor.

unit test contains examples:
