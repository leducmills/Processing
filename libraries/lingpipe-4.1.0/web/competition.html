<h2>LingPipe's Competition</h2>



<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Contributing to this Page</h2>
<p>
If you know of a natural language toolkit that's not listed on
this page, or if you have a clarification or correction for what
we list, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>On this page, we break our competition down into academic
toolkits and industrial toolkits.  We only consider software
that is available for linguistic processing, not companies that
rely on linguistic processing in an application but do not
sell that technology.
</p>

<p>How does LingPipe compare to the below offerings? A few key points
to keep in mind as you browse the offerings:
</p>

<ul>

<li>We are a Geek2Geek business. Nearly every sale we have ever
made was started by a programmer with a problem to solve.
</li>

<li>We are dedicated to making it easier to use linguistics in
applications. We know that using linguistics requires a different view
of computation and want to make it part of a well rounded developer's
skill set. How?

<ul>
  <li>We document extensively, write tutorials, build demos, and
        then do it some more.
  </li>
  <li>We present LingPipe to Java groups and to students.</li>
  <li>We sponsor hobby nights at our office in Brooklyn.</li>
  <li>We release the source code. The Royalty Free License makes it
      maximally easy to prototype and experiment.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>We claim no "magic pixie dust" proprietary algorithms. Our goal is
to provide industrial strength implementations of proven, well
understood technologies. That said, LingPipe is used a good deal in
research systems as a foundation over which to explore new ideas.</li>

<li>We have free support on the Yahoo! group LingPipe and offer paid support
as well.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Academic and Open Source Competition</h2>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Goals of Academic Systems</h2>
<p>
Most of the academic systems have been put together with an emphasis on
accuracy.  This is typically derived from state-of-the-art
machine learning and/or inference algorithms.  While accurate,
these methods tend to be much slower to train and decode
than the commercial systems such as LingPipe.
</p>
<p>
Some of the academic systems, such as NLTK, were defined primarily as
teaching aids.  Others, such as OpenNLP and GATE, were developed in
order to provide baseline tools to a large community.
</p>
</div>

<p>The following is a list of ongoing large-scale, multi-function
natural language toolkits that are built and distributed by academics.
</p>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>One-off Academic Efforts</h2>
<p>
There are hundreds of software packages released by academics that
perform either a single task or illustrate a single point.  We have
compiled a list of lists of these at the bottom of the page in the:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#other">Other Lists of NLP Tools Section</a></li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="sidebar">
<h2>Search, Speech, Translation, OCR, ...?</h2>
<p>
We have intentionally not listed competitors focused on things
other than basic language processing tools.
</p>
<p>Companies in these businesses are more likely to
be LingPipe customers than LingPipe competitors.

<p>ABNER is a statistical named entity recognizer &quot;using linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) with a variety of orthographic and contextual features. Version 1.5 includes two models trained on the NLPBA and BioCreative corpora, for which performance is roughly state of the art.  The new version also includes a Java API allowing users to incorporate ABNER into their systems, as well as train and use models for other data.&quot;  Written by Burr

<p>
&quot;With the multiplication of on-line document repositories and the
phenomenal growth of the Web, a fantastic amount of information is
available at our fingertips. The central problem becomes that of
quickly accessing, within that mass, the arbitrary pieces of
information that are needed at any given time. As a large proportion
of the data is made up of natural language texts, any comprehensive
solution will rely heavily on natural language processing (NLP). Our
research agenda concerns theories, methods, tools and systems that
make it possible to uncover the content of natural language
texts.&quot;

XRCE provides demos and licenses for software for finite state automat,
machine learning for categorization and clustering, robust parsing
and semantics.  You can find some online demos and links to research
software from the above link.

<p>Lots of other groups have put together lists like this.  They contain
many links to one-off packages and many lists
almost all more comprehensive on the one-off packages (like Adwait
Ratnaparkhi's tagger, Michael Collins's parser, Eric Brill's tagger,
the YamCha SVM tagger, the Cambridge-CMU language toolkit, etc.)
